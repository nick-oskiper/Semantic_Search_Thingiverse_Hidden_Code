This model of the iconic Seattle Space Needle stands 40 cm tall.  
[7/20/2015] Update: Fixed the center screw and made the antenna thicker.
Instructions
This model prints without supports though you may want to use a raft for the tall slender pieces. You may need to glue the lower part of the top  observation deck to the legs and the bottom part of the legs to the base. The rest of the pieces screw together so that they can be separated for transportation or replaced if broken.  
For best results printing the antennae in Top1.stl set fan power to 100% and use a minimum layer duration of 5 seconds.

Summary
The trouble with 3D printing a ball bearing is that spheres don't adhere to the 45 degree rule, so they tend to print poorly, or if metal balls are used instead, then the bearing requires assembly. This is a new kind of bearing that can only be manufactured by 3D printing and comes preassembled.
It is a planetary gearset and functions like a cross between a needle bearing and a thrust bearing. No cage is required to keep the rollers in place, because their gearing keeps them perfectly spaced. The gears are all herringbone, which is why it cannot be disassembled and also why it can act as a thrust bearing. If you're wondering how well a 3D printed bearing could work under load, please check out my video: http://youtu.be/ZghwSBiM0sU
This design is fully parametric and made to be adjusted in the Customizer app to whatever you need. Thanks to aubenc for finding a problem in the first version.
Instructions
The key to any bearing is the tolerance between the moving parts. Since this is printed all at once, you want the minimum tolerance possible, where any less would fuse the parts together. I print these with the MakerWare medium defaults on my Replicator 1 and it requires a fair bit of torque to break it free at first. It's designed to fit onto the standard English hex size for screwdriver bits, so you can use a tool to help turn it. Running it in a drill for a few minutes helps to smooth out the rotation. 
You can adjust the tolerance in Customizer if you need. You can also change the dimensions, numbers of planets, numbers of teeth, etc. Normal gears use a small pressure angle in order to transmit torque, but here I use a large pressure angle so that they transmit force better (hence why they look more pointed than usual). Your chosen number of sun gear teeth is approximate because planetary gearboxes turn out to be quite constrained in terms of what tooth numbers will fit. See the beginning of my code for the equation I came up with.

There is no Anet branding on their printers, so I created this for decoration.
How I Designed This
Designed in Sketchup Make 2017. 
The original screws were not long enough, so I added a bit more height to the posts in order to use some longer M3 screws that I had on hand.

Keep From Getting Shocked! The most popular 12 Volt Power Supplies used have an exposed 115 VAC to 230 VAC Live Terminal Exposed! This Cover is easily printed, has snap fit retention (no screws needed) and is available with or without a switch hole. Few things on Thingiverse can actually save a life, this is one of them. The life you save, might be your own.
Instructions
Print, feed your wires through the wire hole, and install. 
If you print the one with the switch hole, I use a standard (extrememly popular) size. The hole is for switches that need a 20mm x 13mm. If you want to change it, I have provided both the Google Sketchup File and STL Files for both. 
If you do use a switch, I would recommend the supply side live 115 - 230 VAC switched.
The hole for the wires is large enough for any wires you will install, but small enough that little fingers can never touch the live line.
If you need help how to hook it up, here's a video at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27lcqgOBb2c

Generate your own nuts, bolts, washers and threaded rod by simply typing the required parameters into customizer.  Great for replacing metal equivalents in many applications such as the ROLLER RING |  Universal Filament Spool Holder http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:176442.  
Includes options to generate WingNuts for easy hand tightening and removal.  Now includes socket cap, socket button and socket countersunk head types with support for socket, phillips and slot drives. You can also join threaded rod to form unlimited lengths by creating a custom extended joiner nut.  Uses the PolyScrewThread library from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8796
NEW Updated version 6/3/2016: added extended options to control number of facets on nuts, square sockets (or any number of facets) and socket depth control.
NEW Updated version 1/1/2017: modified library code to remove dependence on deprecated 'assign' statement.

Notes:
Defaults are for a 8mm diameter bolts, rod, matching nuts and wing nuts that work well together (at least with my printer settings) without cleanup or modification. Please be patient rendering and compiling longer components as the rendering is very calculation intensive.
Some default parameters such as the nut outer diameter are deliberately slightly larger than the bolt diameter to produce a snug fit that can still be hand tightened. Some have suggested a 0.8mm difference works well. This may need to be altered depending on individual printer variances, slicing tools, filament etc. Some cleanup may also be required around socket openings depending on first layer print preferences.
I suggest printing a matching bolt and nut and adjusting as necessary. Note: slow print speeds and solid fill are recommended for best results. Printing more than one at a time to improve layer cooling works well.
Use a brim of about 2mm for printing threaded rod and it should be stable up to about 150 mm in length. You can extend the length by creating nut joiners. For example, an 18mm nut height will join two rod lengths very strongly.

Here is a Universal Joint for your printing pleasure.  When printing scale the pin file down a bit to make it fit easier and allow for movement.  The assembly is not print ready so only print the parts if you want to assemble it.  I have included the inventor files for your use.  I have added new threaded STL files for the Fork and Studs.
Instructions
If you choose to print this I would reduce the scale of the pin prior to printing so it fits well enough to allow for movement.

Assembly manual
Assembling is really easy and straightforward. There are a few things you need to pay attention during printing and assembling:
You have to adjust your printing settings for ""link.stl"". I separated link into 2 sections for easier printing. If you noticed that it's ""glued"" together, use negative XY correction in your slicer settings (""Horizontal expansion"" in Cura, ""XY size compensation"" in Slic3r)
If everything works correctly, glue it together with piece of 1.75mm filament inside.
Linkage should looks like this:

Update May 2018 see lienbacher's comment below for a version that will work with a Pi 3 B+, which has addition POE pins.  I updated the v2.1 version on here with a larger pin cutout but don't have a Pi 3 B+ to test with
Updated March 2018: Added a new version (2.0) with a larger cutout for the microSD card since newer models aren't spring loaded.  I also loosened up the tolerances and tweaked the design to make it easier to print, and added a latch to the cap so the Raspberry Pi is less likely to fall out.
Simple sleeve to protect a Raspberry Pi* from falling screws.  The main part of the case slides over the Raspberry Pi, and a cap fits around the connectors.  The parts are only held in place by friction so it probably isn't a good option for transport or if you frequently plug / unplug devices (mine just sits under my printer running Octoprint).  Only the ports along the sides are exposed.  
The cap part may need a small amount scaling on the z axis since the height can vary significantly with layer height and first layer thickness.  
Filament:
-- Colorfabb Red PLA/PHA*
-- ESun Yellow PLA*
-- Filamentum Vertigo Grey PLA*
-- Sainsmart Clear PETG*

Additional shell design stls available here.
This 3d printed turtle uses the same flex concept from my Mini Monster Truck to create legs that allow the toy to bounce and scurry around when tapped. The head can also retract into the shell.
Check out my process for designing this thing here
The model assembles with the printed H-Clips and needs no glue. The parts print without the need for supports.

This design will probably not work with a brim unless you spend time sanding and cleaning up the edges at the base of the print. This will stick the springs together and make the center channel for the head narrower. Using a raft might also affect this.
If you are having trouble with the head sliding, I have uploaded 3 head files with the stem portion scaled to be narrower:
Head95.stl - 95% original width
Head9.stl - 90% original width

Summary
A model loggerhead turtle with moveable flippers. You could call it an ""action figure"", but there's a distinct absence of mutation and/or martial arts training for this little guy!  
All four flippers are attached by ball joints that are captured during the printing process. The front and back halves of the model snap together with the included H-clip.  
Some cool info about loggerheads: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isjxWHoMz1E  
Just want to print it?
Then ""Loggerhead_plated.STL"" is the file for you!   
Switch off automatic supports in your slicer software. There are only two supports needed and they're included in the STL. Don't forget to snap them off with pliers after printing.  
Plate it yourself? Dual Extruder? Soluble supports?
Download ""Loggerhead_unplated.zip"" and may The Force be with you.
Instructions
The model is designed to print with only two supports (included in the STL) for the rear flipper ball joints in the back half of the model.  
After printing the back half its supports should be removed with pointy-nosed pliers. You should see a kind of crown pattern where the support and and the ball meet. It doesn't really matter if you can't get the whole support out - the back flippers will still move, but not quite as much.  
The joints have a 0.5mm clearance when printed at 100% scale, which should be fine for most printers. If they feel too loose after printing then try heating the model and pressing the surrounding plastic to tighten the socket.  
Depending on your printer and slicer calibration the very first layer may fuse the ball and socket together in the front half of the model. If this happens then carefully cut through to the gap with a hobby knife after printing. Update: I have uploaded a version designed to minimise any first layer fusing (see Loggerhead_NoFuseJoints_plated.STL).  
The two halves will join together best if the surface between them is perfectly flat. For this reason I would suggest printing without a raft if possible (or sanding off any marks it leaves).

I really like to create movable toys that you can print pre-assembled, so I made a little friend for the Ape figurine.
If you like me to spend more time adding animals to the zoo, please consider supporting me by buying my models for cheap on http://3dsha.re/portfolio/?id=97 :o)   
*Update: Version 2.0 has more support included that will make it stick better to the platform and will help getting a smoother print.   
*Update: Version 2.1 the different parts are now solid, the toys seems strong enough without the inner walls so this means faster printing.  
Instructions
It's a easy print and doesn't need support anymore!
I updated the Turtle with some minor changes and also included a small pillar under the neck that you have to break or cut off after printing, this might be a bit tricky, let me know please.
I would also advise to use a brim to keep the different parts better in place while printing.
The latest version should print within a few hours and uses about 4 grams of plastics with the settings below:   
Print speed 50 mm/s
Bottom, outer wall and top 0.5 mm
Layer height 0.15 mm
Infill 25% with a speed of 75 mm/s   
If you want a really nice print, just lower the layer height.

If you look inside the planter, there are two more turtles on the back of this ""Squishy Turtle"" by jakejake. Its bouncy legs and retractable head make it fun to play with. Feel free to copy and tinker with the model on Tinkercad.
Is this planet actually flat? If so, what holds up the Earth?
""Turtles all the way down"" is an expression of the infinite regress problem in cosmology posed by the ""unmoved mover"" paradox. The metaphor in the anecdote represents a popular notion of the model that Earth is actually flat and is supported on the back of a World Turtle, which itself is propped up by a column of turtles. Questioning what the final turtle might be standing on, the anecdote humorously concludes that it is ""turtles all the way down"". (Wikipedia)
Choose your favorite version of the Shell Pot part, and print one of everything else, except the ""H"" clip, print and install two of those. Here's the assembly video from JakeJake's thing

Summary
The cutest animal hybrid from Avatar: The Last Airbender, exported at 8 cm long but it should be good to scale.
How I Designed This
My first model for printing, I sculpted with Blender and used its 3d-print toolbox to check for errors so it should be good to go. I used scenes from the show and this beautiful render by Typhen as reference

This is a little desktop model of a retro ""turtle sandbox."" It comes in three approximate diameters: 50, 100, and 150 mm (2, 4, and 6 inches). The photo shows the middle size.
Scale the STLs from the nearest size if you want a specific diameter. They're mostly identical but some wall thicknesses and clearances are different.
The lid and base are in separate files because the lid needs supports under it, but the base does not.

You'd think he's slow, but once Gustav gets his shell waxed and buffed to a shine, he's actually pretty speedy. In fact, if you fill his bowl full of iceberg lettuce, he'll fly like a racecar trapped in a reptile's body.

Summary
Its a turtle head (turtle neck included)
There are 2 holes at the bottom so you could also hang it on the wall. It however also works great standing. Making the head look out of something like a box should be nice as well.
The default size is pretty big. Scale it down to whatever turtle size you like. I printed mine in Wood PLA.
Prints without support.
A message on behalf of all the turtles:
Be mindful where you put your plastic trash. Small traces can end up in their bellies while bigger parts can be stuck around their body parts.

Summary
This is a pocket sized turbo whistle or siren which emits a loud and extremely annoying WHEEEEEEEEEEE when you blow into it.  I've done a full write-up on Instructables : http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Orange-Screamer/  and you can see a video of it in action here : https://vimeo.com/105474925. (The camera mic doesn't really pick up the full range and volume of it.)
This design was inspired by Instructables user Kiteman, who published a perspex laser cut version. 
Instructions
The rotor sits on the spindle and then the lid is glued on with cyanoacrylate adhesive.  However, you will get best performance if you slightly sand the parts in contact to get rid of any roughness left from the printing.  A drop of light oil or silicone spray in the works before gluing will help things too.  Reducing friction is the name of the game.  
In the ZIP file there are files for the body, rotor and lid in RSDOC format (the native Designspark format) and STL format. I've also included files in SketchUp (V8) format, a THING file for use directly on a MakerBot and a file with just one rotor blade in case anyone wants to play around with the geometry. (The SKP files are an export from Designspark and I haven't tested how well they import into SketchUp.)

Nine different little low poly pumpkins ready to be printed for Halloween. Included are: Chompy, Slurpy, Crushy, Piercy, Slicey, Crunchy, Munchy, Smoochy and Squashy
They print quick without any support.
They can be stacked by snapping them together. LED lights can be put in them through the bottom.
Use single little pumpkins as decorations or stack them together then you can have them as a tower or hang them up.
Want to print them bigger and use a torch light with them? - Here is something for it: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1091056

Notes:
The versions with Extra Edgy in the name prevent the printer from smoothing out the edges. If you like to print them significantly bigger I recommend printing the normal version.
1 pumpkin takes around 5 gram of filament so with 1kg filament you could print roughly 200 little pumpkins.
Print the Cross Stand if you like to build a tower with them. Note: Some of the snapping connections can be a bit shaky.

I've seen something similar on Pinterest and decided to design my own, with a more modern/cute and less cheesy design. 
The original size is pretty small for children and can be dangerous if they're swallowed, so I recommend printing at least 25% bigger if it's a gift for kids :)

My 3 year old son has an Easter theme at school. All kids were asked to bring along Rabbits. As he is such a big fan of Flexi Rex, I decided to remix the T-rex into an Easter Bunny. 
I used the Flexi Rex with Stronger links from DrLex as a base. And as well applied the same eyebrow and eye. 
My son was super proud to take his rabbit with him to school. 
Do not forget to share a picture of your Flexi Rabbit when it is made. So Flexi can officially meet his brothers; sisters, nephews etc.
Thanks in advance!

This cute bunny rabbit really wants that carrot, but it's stuck under the door! This doorstop is easy to print as long as you add some supports under the arms.
Thanks to Reddit user Gabe2252, he modeled this in Blender and I only had to tweak the ears a bit to make it printable.

On an earlier prototype with different ears (seen in the third photo), I forgot to add supports under the arms and they started to curl up and out of control, and they caught on the print head, causing a skip. Once I saw the problem, I was able to pause, home it, and continue printing.

The model looks better when painted. I used acrylic paint after priming it with Gesso primer.

Adding to my 3D Printed slime collection this time is the food and plorts from the Dry Reef region. I created the models in Fusion 360 and Zbrush.
After I finished modeling I prepared the models using Simplify3D, then printed them on the Robo R2.
Then my wife painted them using a combination of primer, airbrush and paintbrush paints. She mostly used the airbrush for the main colors and all the fancy gradient work. Then she used her paintbrush for the smaller details like the eyes and mouth.
I'm really happy with how these came out. Let me know what you think! And I'll be adding more to this Slime Rancher series very soon!

Deer ate the carrot nose off of our snowman.  My over-tired 4-year old son was very upset and my wife said ""your Dad will print you a new one that the deer won't eat,"" and he calmed down.  A quick search of Thingiverse revealed that I would have to model my own.
I did so very quickly and it's not my best, but here it is.  Ready to print and be installed on a snowman near you.  
Instructions
Scale in accordance with your snowman.  Print in orange.  Make sure your printer slows down for the uppermost layers so they have time to cool.

Market stall and baskets sized for Sylvanian families or Playmobil. There are links to most of the wares in the picture below.
Special thanks to Thingiverse user ritabunny who sent pictures and ideas to use as inspiration!
Description
The booth has 4 main parts which stays together without glue. The awning can either be printed in parts to get a multi-colored awning, or as just one or two pieces. The awning doesn't need to be glued but it's probably best to glue the different awning parts together if they are printed separately. No glue has been used for the market booth in the printed pictures.

The V-Stacker is a simple system designed to save space and keep your long vegetables and bananas organized. Instead of these items ending up in a pile on the bottom of your fridge vege drawer the V-Stacker can be placed in the same area and stack them up vertically using what was previously unused / waste space. . 
This is an easy to use system that some may find of use... three simple prints are required. 2 x Uprights and 1 x Joiner. Easy prints then just clip together (Refer to the images for and print settings for additional information)
A second 'wide' version has been added to accommodate 'larger' vegetables. The centre section width has been increased from 45mm to 65mm for this version.    
The design has been made to a height that should fit into most refrigerator vegetable drawers (155m tall).
Note: If you like this check out the rest of my practical and fun designs.

In need for a healthy snack? Have a carrot!
This carrot gives you the perfect excuse/hiding place for as little of 18grams of candy. Healthy enough for your youngster to get a treat in his/her lunchbox ;)

Notes:
The Carrot body was printed with my Diamond Hotend, mixing 50% yellow, 45%red and the remaining 5% was transparent for one of the carrots, green for the other carrot.
You can be the judge of the realism price winning vegatable.
I used variable later height: the finer (0.1) for the thread, 0.3 for the rest of the model.
I exported the tip of the carrot separately. Don't use it if you want to be super careful with sharp edges... Sleeping Beauty etc...

Carrot Gravity Toy Knife Generation 2 Was great, but had some real Issues with the file Names messing up the download. And I didn't like having to glue it together. So I have modified it and re uploaded it. But in the time I was working on it, I can't find the original file 
UPDATE: the creator reached out to me. in the comments And here is the link to the originals:
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Sw411v79X/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0
https://www.crealitycloud.cn/user/2582633251
Also, if you have a tap and die set and you want to clean up the threads, I used. M5X0.8 for the small one. And M7X1.0 for the big ones.
UPDATE: I added some looser tolerance files I shrunk the blade by point 2 millimeters in each direction and the outer edge of the pins. So hopefully the blade moves smoother. 
Note, if your printer is capable of making the pins in the handle. and you print the updated ones. The handle won't flip open properly. It'll jam each time because it is fairly tight tolerant so only. print those if your printer fails at the other ones.

Notes:
Because of the threads, it's highly recommended to use the best resolution you can. I have found it works with layer heights of 0.15 and 0.1 Pretty good.
I printed using Army Green PETG. but I wouldn't recommend PETG Unless you have your printer really dialed for it because you need it to be a pretty good resolution. And PETG has surface finish issues that might need some sanding
Also, when assembling. the bolts/pins. will screw in better on their respective side So if it isn't fitting smoothly, try the other bolt. It's kind of hard to say which one is supposed to be for which side until you try.

How I Designed This
Remixed
The files I used from Gophergames has sweet threads. As that user mentions it works out much better to chase the threads with the respective taps (M5x0.8 & M7x1.0). I didn't use the M7 tap at all. I know most folks wont have them but if you do, it makes assembly that much easier.
If you have a squished first layer like me, you'll want to file/sand the edges of the pins or they my be tight. Also different from the files I used, I print the body together and use normal supports. Just make sure you use the best resolution you can.

The second thing in my Week of Things, some useful, some just for fun.  Thought this would force me to post some of my projects. Most are semi useful/functional and some are purely inspirational.
After planting a few seeds this spring i found myself looking for small signs to show where everything is about to grow. Print on, print many, print in one color, or print in ten, its all up to you. 
If you want more types of vegetables just comment and i'll design them.

Catarina and I made this funnel design in www.openscad.org.  This particular funnel is 50mm wide with a 2mm hole.  We made it because we needed to pour some liquids. :)
Note: the inside overhangs actually killed the print.  we need to adjust the height of the funnel for a better angle.  Cool effect though!
Update: we used the funnel to pour acetone knowing that it would dissolve the threads on the inside.  it completely sealed all the cracks and now its a great little funnel.

Made it for my iPhone 6, but i guess it will fit other models as well. Cable goes through the hole and you're good to go. Will upload pictures when i've printed it, so a simple render is all you get to see for now.
NOTE: I have made this for my own use/preference, so I really don't care if it's not suitable for your specified phone etc.. Please dont nag. If you want to modify, feel free! 
Added the work file, so you can modify it for your own phone.
-Rotate it so it lays 'sideways', then add supports and you're good to go.
Enjoy!

One more octopus arm thingy. This one holds up your tablet or phone!  Should fit an iPhone 4/5 in portrait or landscape no problem.  
Intended scale: 118mm x 114mm x 88 mm (approximately)  
Note this is just an experimental model, I have not printed this myself  
Update: Slight update to the right arm, the tip of it is now pointing upwards with the hope of easing printing without supports ( very hopeful).   
See The New Version: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:213990
It should address many of the issues people have had with this one.

**Update (6/23/2018):  I'm sharing this Fusion 360 model(I hope I did it right):  https://a360.co/2KgA3Z9
I'm sorry to anyone who has tried to contact me.  I've been busy with a full-time job plus engineering classes.  Every time I log in, I see that I have infinity notifications waiting for me to address them. 
But, I finally took the time to figure out how to share the model so you can make changes or fix the model in any way you want.
I'm glad so many people have gotten use out of my design.
**Update (7/24/2017):  Important notes in the print settings.
I've been debating mounting a TV on the ceiling above my bed.  The only reason I haven't done it is because of a fear of being crushed by a falling TV while I'm sleeping.  
This design allows me to watch Youtube, Netflix, or other streaming video while I'm falling asleep.  
Non-Printed Parts:
Adhesive Metal Plate for Magnetic Phone Mounts
4-Pack Enkay 4480-C Magnets
4x Screws that fit in a 5 mm hole with a head diameter no larger than 7.9 mm
4x Wall Anchors for those screws
Electrical Tape
If I had to guess on the screw size based on the charts I found online, I would say it's a #10 screw, but I designed the wall mount around some unlabeled screws and anchors I had lying around.

Notes:
Highly Recommended Settings: Keep parts oriented as I've set them. Some parts will require support. The reasoning is that, when printed on my printer at 20%, there was a consistent weak spot at the base of the threading. If you want to print without supports, you can reorient those parts in your slicer and print at a higher infill, maybe 50%.
Infill: 20%
Wall Width: 1.2 mm
Top Thickness: 1.2 mm
Also, for parts that have to fit together, I highly recommend using one printer to print all the parts. I have found that one of my printers prints marginally larger (0.1-0.2 mm/20 mm), and on larger pieces, the tolerances will be off enough that the pieces will not fit right.
Post-Printing
Magnets
The bottom layers on both of my printers tend to screw with the tolerances.  I had to scrape the rims of the holes for the magnets before they would pop in, essentially widening the diameters for the first couple of layers.
Magnetic Mount Cap
The electrical tape provides a higher-friction surface than the plastic provides.  Place a few strips across the surface of the cap that the phone will sit on, and this helps to prevent the phone from sliding.  
Make sure the cap is screwed down firmly to minimize the distance from the adhesive metal plate on the back of your phone and the magnets.

Summary
This Tablet / Phone stand is a super simple stylish design. The stand was designed to be as small as possible, so it is quick and easy to print as well as not consuming a lot of filament, but adequate to hold most tablets and phones in either orientation. 
You can use a tablet or phone in the stand however if it slides around too much on hard surfaces (as plastic can) the base / footprint could easily have thin foam  rubber padding added to make it non-slip.   
Seven files have been provided to accommodate devices from <7mm thick up to 13mm thick in 1mm increments plus a 16mm version. Just measure the thickness of your tablet or phone and print the file of the next size up..... so a tablet measuring 8.25mm is best in the 9mm stand. This ensures a snug fit. It's easy... but please remember clearance is required so a 10mm thick device will not fit a 10mm stand... print the 11mm stand. 
The Tablet / Phone Stand should work well for most tablets and phones provided the correct file is used for a snug fit. 
This is a super easy print. Print them in your favourite color/s (pause and change colours part way through if you want to get creative) and great as a small gift. 
Please refer to the print settings and images for additional information... and please post images of your stand/s in use for others to see.  
Note: If you like this check out the rest of my practical and fun designs.
Tips: Tips are not expected but are appreciated as they help offset my filament costs as much as anything else. However, as I live outside the USA tips cannot be sent to me via PayPal.Me as that service is not supported in my region and this is beyond Thingverse's control. If you feel like sending a tip please use regular PayPal and send it to muzz64nz@gmail.com and, to those who do,  thanks in advance!

Summary
This project is a mounting system for lightweight objects such as phones and small cameras. The joint is compatible with GoPro mount.
Phone clamp assembly video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6nm0oOSpfQ
If you find this design helpful, consider to support my work. Thanks in advance.
UPDATE [2020-11-15]:
- Updated holder for phone clamp so it can swap orientation.
UPDATE [2020-11-18]:
- New M5 knobs. More tolerance on Phone clamp.
- Be sure to read the description before ask questions in comment area.
FEATURES:
It is designed to be modular to provide flexible use. The system has potential to mount most phones and small cameras onto a wide range of objects. Using same parts printed for different purpose is the major approach.
The included phone clamp can grab phones very firmly. And it is suitable for phones from about 55mm wide to 95mm wide (iPhone 4 - iPhone 12 Pro Max and bigger). The clamp hook was angled so it won't be able to reach and accidentally press the buttons on the side of phone.
The modules can be used with GoPro compatible equipment. The bolts and nuts included in the design are standard M5. It's hightly recommended to use metal bolts and nuts for the arm. There is also a printable version if anyone is interested to try out.
With this modular system, I will be developing new add-ons to it. Feel free to watch this thing. Many of the objects designed for GoPro are already usable for this setup. If anyone wants to make remix, STEP files are available here.
ACHIEVED APPLICATIONS:
Phone/Camera/GoPro mount
Desk clamp for phone/camera.
Stand for phone.
Headphone stand.
And much more applications in REMIX section of original page.
MAKING:
It is highly recommended to print with complete support interface for the parts in this project. Support interface would give a flat bottom which result in a better mechanical performance.
The orientation of stl files are already thought through during my testing. Try printing at the current orientation unless you run into problems. It is not recommended to reorient the arms to save support material. The tabs will be easy to break if printed otherwise.
The bolt is oriented horizontally for optimised strength. Bottom teeth is trimmed off for printing easily. It acts very similar to a full thread. Only the phone clamp bolt (M5x65) is recommended to use printed version. All the bolts for arms should be metal if possible.
NOTES:
It is not recommended to extend the arm too long. General filament is not strong enough to take that much lateral load at this size and the arm would be very wobbly. And the arms are optimized to stay still. If you wish to use this design as selfie stick or similar purpose, please be careful with the material strength and use at you own risk.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
The joints are inspired by GoPro design.
The foldable arm is inspired by ""GoPro counter balance folding stick. by UltiArjan"" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:433378).
Bolts and nuts are created with the awesome customizer ""NUT JOB | Nut, Bolt, Washer and Threaded Rod Factory by mike_mattala"" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:193647).
The desk clamp is inspired by ""G-Clamp fully printable by johann517"" (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1673030).
Thank you all for your great work so that I could accomplish this project.

UPDATE HISTORY
22/03/17 - The phone clamp knob originally uploaded has issue of screw poping out of knob instead of knob pulling the clamp out. A new knob named ""M5 knob for phone v2 tighter"" with smaller hole is uploaded for the socket to firmly grab the bolt. ""Phone clamp down nongrab"" is an old backup version which the clamp doesn't pull out while unscrewing the knob.
02/04/17 - More variation of arms. Added more tolerance to the arms.
13/04/17 - A holder that grabs the phone clamp less tight. (Phone clamp holder v2)
20/04/17 - After a period of use, the printed bolts or nuts start to give up, especially the nuts, not able to lock the arms in place. They are more like a temporary solution. I would buy metal bolts to replace them.
24/04/17 - New version of the knob for phone clamp. More convenient to twist. Smaller diameter. (M5 knob for phone v3)
26/04/17 - New version of the knob for the joints with smaller diameter. The long knob is no longer needed. (M5 knob short v3)
09/05/17 - Longer M5x65 bolt for wide phones larger than 5.5 inch. (M5x65_D)
18/05/17 - Mount for lightweight cameras. (Camera Mount & Camera Screw)
18/05/17 - Moved the position of the nut in phone clamp, making it extend 10mm longer with M5x65 bolt. (Phone clamp down v3)
18/05/17 - Slightly more tolerance to holes for bolt. Minor change.
04/06/17 - New version of the knobs with better grip. (M5 knob short v4, M5 knob for phone v4)
31/08/17 - New C clamp with the same width as the arms, not requiring support.
14/02/18 - 4mm thicker phone clamp for phones with case. (Phone_clamp_down_4mm_thicker, Phone_clamp_up_4mm_thicker)
25/04/18 - Headphone stand attachment. (headphone holder.stl)
27/07/19 - V5 major update. Better aesthetics, better tolerance. Stronger C-Clamps.
20/03/20 - Rotating Holder removed. Not reliable enough in long term.
19/10/20 - M5 bolts updated. Thread made deeper. Less likely to strip.
10/10/20 - The phone clamp is updated with a better knob with no chance of bolt popping out. New printed bolt without support and threaded knobs.
15/10/20 - Updated holder for phone clamp so it can swap orientation.
18/10/20 - New M5 knobs. More tolerance on Phone clamp.

Summary
This is a universal clamp to use a phone with a standard tripod camera mount.I couldn't seem to find one of these so I just made one for myself. I also used the opportunity to try out a new thread mechanism I was toying with.
This design features angled clamping surfaces that don't interfere with the volume buttons (on my phone). The base also incorporates a spring-loaded jaw for smoother tightening on the phone, adding wax from a candle / soap bar makes tightening smoother as well.
See it working:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxVFlWWsE6Q
Additional parts needed:
-1/4-20 size nut for the tripod attachment
-wax to put on threads
If you don't have access to the thinner ""jam"" nut used for this, check out this remix by DorffMeister.

Summary
A lightweight simple universal phone and tablet stand.
After years of user testing and evaluating different designs – numerous angles, lip heights, widths, heights, lengths and styles with various phones and tables – the newest design (version 3) is the most refined phone and tablet stand to date.
NB: Print in mm for correct size.  
Supports most devices less than 14mm thick (including the devices cover).
Versions:
Version 1: Universal_Phone_Stand.stl (does not support tablets)
Version 2: Universal_Phone_and_Tablet_Stand.stl
Version 3: Universal_Phone_and_Tablet_Stand_V3.stl
Update notes:
Version 2 has a stiffer and longer back to support larger devices such as tablets. I also found that I could reduce the height of the front grips without decreasing the reliability. This gives more visible device real estate and easier access to device buttons.
Version 3 is refined in every way – from the angle, lip height, width, height, length and design style.
Tested Phones:
LG G2, LG G3, LG G6, HTC One M8, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Samsung Galaxy Note 5, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Samsung Galaxy S3 mini, Samsung Galaxy S5 mini, Samsung Galaxy S3, Samsung Galaxy S4, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy S6, Apple iPhone 4S, Apple iPhone 5, Apple iPhone 5s, Apple iPhone 6, Apple iPhone 6s, Apple iPhone 7, Apple iPhone 8, Hisense Infinity H3 U988, BlackBerry Bold 9790, Sony Xperia E1, Huawei Ascend G7, Huawei Nexus 6P, Huawei P9 and the Nokia Lumia 520.
Tested Tablets:
Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2014 Edition), Samsung P1000 Galaxy Tab, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1, Mecer A890A Windows Tablet, Apple iPad mini 2 and ASUS ZenPad 10.
Acknowledgements
Thanks to Scott Grant for helping with the refining of the design
Thanks to Peter Banda and Thashen Padayachy for helping with the photography.
Let me know if it supports your phone or tablet and I'll add it to the tested list - thanks.

I did yet another remix of WindoAC's elephant phone holder, simply because it was so cool!  
Did another one that doesn't require supports anymore, by filling up the gap below. I guess the gap may have been more suitable for saving material when doing injection molding, but it's much simpler like this for 3D printing.

No supports required. Print away!

Summary
These simple cat and dog device stands are a quick print (2-3hrs) and a fun addition to any animal lover's desk. The device holding portion of them (tail/lower back) are identical so they can be mixed and matched (dog/dog, cat/cat, dog/cat)
They should accommodate most phones/tablets/e-readers that don't have a bulky Otterbox style case on them. They will support a full size iPad, although in portrait orientation it could be a little top heavy. Smaller devices may only need one of the stands instead of a pair.
FOR BEST RESULTS, STANDS SHOULD BE ORIENTED LAYING ON THEIR SIDE
Designed using OnShape.
Happy printing and please share any makes!

It's a flat-fold flippin' phone stand!  
This folding phone stand has 5 angle settings: 30°, 45°, 50°, 55° and 60°.  
The best thing about it? It can be folded into a 8mm-thick piece of flat plastic!  
Suitable for most smartphones not thicker than 12mm.  
2D dimensions: 50mm x 60mm (alt. size provided: 50mm x 80mm)
Thickness of each part: 4mm
Holder hook depth: 10.5mm ~ 12.2mm
Holder notches gap: 24mm  
No bolts required, just print and assemble. Refer to the instructions.  
This thing is created with FreeCAD. Source files included.
Instructions
Parts:  
1x Backplate  
1x Base  
2x Hook  
1x Stand  
Note that for the backplate and hook models, there is a variant with support and it is recommended to use that variant.  
For the base and the stand, the given size is 50x60mm, but an alternative size of 50x80mm is available. You can also download the freecad source files and adjust the dimensions yourself (though be extremely careful since changing the constraints will sometimes mess up other parts.  
Print Instructions:  
Print with no support.  
The backplate and hook models already contains custom brim and support for easier printing, but you can choose to print the models without them. Do note that even though cleaning up the support is kind of a PITA, printing without may be even more troublesome.  
The recommended layer height is 0.1mm with 0.2mm first layer.  
If you use an extra brim, make sure to clean up the brim around the hinge axles.  
Cut away the brim and support, and sand if necessary.  
Assemble the stand. Do note that there is a flat position on the hinges which allows easier insertion at a certain angle. Use your hand to feel the hinge to decide the insertion angle. Refer to the instruction image.  
Flip and place phone on it. :)

Summary
The shoes hold a phone with a 4"" screen quite easily but for larger phones you make wish to enlarge it to fit. The texture of the printing looks very much in keeping with a fabric covered shoe.
The original shoe file was loaded into Meshmixer and chopped up and reassembled to leave the shoe with a cutout for the phone to stand in. The original shoe was large, maybe full size so this was resized to be 75mm high. Back in Meshmixer the shoe was then mirrored to make a matching pair and two shoe moved to slightly overlap near the toes.
This was loaded into Cura to make ready for printing in PLA with a layer height of 0.2mm and 60% fill. A Brim was used in Cura to stabilise the printing on the table, particularly for the heel as this part is a high thin print until it joins the rest of the shoe. You may wish to add supports to the high heel to stabilise it more during the printing.
Mk3 Version
The only problem I've had with printing is the alignment of the tall heel to the body of the shoe when the two get to meet up. I've added support to lock the heel to the instep around half way up and this solves the problem. Still printed at 75mm high on a brim at 0.2mm and 60% fill.

Notes:
Make sure to use ABS if you live in a hotter country as PLA deforms at around 60 degrees celsius so it cannot be left in the car.
A photo of the print orientations is included above.
A higher infill on the arms to make them heavier (up to 100%) and a lower infill on the sled to make it lighter (down to 20%) allows the mount to more easily retain the open position without the use of a rubber band.
Post-Printing
1. Clean the parts
Remove the support structure and deburr the print bed side of the sliding surfaces, highlighted below.
2. Insert the Clip
Push the clip into the small rectangular hole on the back plate as pictured below. This will take quite a bit of force. 
3. Assemble the parts
First, insert the sled into the backplate and then insert the arms as pictured below. This is easiest done if it is on the edge of a table so the clip can overhang and the parts can lay flat. Then clip the front plate on. 
4. Add the rubber band (Optional)
This step could take a few attempts to get just right. A rubber band is wrapped around the two posts and through the slot in the sled. The hard part is finding the right rubber band as it needs to be strong enough to open the arms when the phone is removed but not so strong that the arm cannot close around the phone when it is inserted. I did not have the right one so I tied a knot in a larger one and cut off the excess, adding a bit of superglue to make sure it doesn't come undone.

Summary
Lamp with Ancient Greek meander patterns. Somewhat easy print since it's printed flat, and scalable to fit smaller beds.
Instructions
1 Print. Part1 and part2 should be printed solid and with 2 walls. More details on this below. If your first layer is good everything else will be smooth sailing, so you might want to print it at higher temperature and maybe a bit slower.
2 Glue up. Bend part1 and part2 and glue it all together. If some parts are hard to bend you can lightly score the bends with the back of a knife.
3 Light it up. Place a IKEA HALVKLART or IKEA LEDBERG (discontinued) with the lens removed in the middle of the bottom part. IKEA KAPPLAKE reportedly also works, and all lamps with a single small exposed LED should work.
For more information I recommend checking out this make which has tons of tips on printing and assembly.
Printing & scaling
When slicing, make sure that the part of the bottom layer that's going to be bent goes diagonally or perpendicularly as in the picture. You may need to experiment with wall count and line width. I used 2 walls at 0.5mm wide for the full sized version.
This model can be scaled to fit a ~200mm bed. Just scale normally and make sure that you still get a proper bottom layer. You may need to lower layer width slightly to get the correct bend as described above. There is also a remix with a cut up version that can be printed in full size on a smaller bed.

Summary
I live in Paris and I love this city. Yes, it's beautiful, filled with impressive architecture, history and culture, but what I enjoy the most in Paris is the enthusiasm most citizen share for good food, music and ""happy hours"" in their favorite cafe. What happened last Friday, only a few meters from the bar I chose to celebrate the weekend with my friends, can't be described. My way to fight these barbarian is to keep celebrating what they hate. History, liberty, art and love of beauty on earth.
This Lamp inspired by Gustave Eiffel's most famous construction is a reminder that the city of light will always be the symbol of all these things, no matter what they do to it.

Creative Tools Creative Tools supplies 3D printer and 3D scanner products incl filaments, accessories and support and also 3D software for leading CAD, modeling, animation, and rendering.
A fully 3D-printable rotating stand for filament spools, designed to be easily made without the need for fasteners such as screws, nuts, shafts, glue, etc. Every single component in this spool holder comes right from your 3D printer's filament.
The spool holder's spindle is shaped to fit the vast majority of commonly used filament spools with shaft holes ranging from 16 mm to 62 mm in diameter. It is also compatible with spool-less filament coils.
The spindle which holds the spool's weight rotates on its own roller wheels, which makes it turn effortlessly.
The spool holder included an arm for filament guide tubes of both common sizes 1.75 mm and 3.0 mm. The arm also contains a pocket for inserting a piece of sponge which acts a a filament filter - thus keeping the filament clean and lubricated.  
FEATURES
Easy to 3D print
Needs no glue or fasteners
All parts can be 3D-printed
Fits almost any filament spool size
Has built-in filament filter!
Can also hold spool-less filament coils
Base versions available for standing on flat surfaces or fit on extruded aluminium profiles.
Next time you need a new filament spool holder, just 3D-print one! :)

Detailed step-by-step instructions: http://bit.ly/1z5hr5t  
3D-print only what you need while testing!
As you already realise this image is not the entire filament spool stand (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:508896). It shows a crucial part and best-practice related to 3D-printing.  
As with any product development one never knows exactly from start how things will fit together.  
Depending on what 3D printer and settings you use, this spool stand will take a few hours to print. It is therefore unnecessary to 3D-print lengthy product iterations just to find out that you need to change a portion of the whole design.  
The 3D-prints shown in this image represent the parts of the model with fittings which we wanted to give a test-run before we defined the final dimensions.   
Therefore we cut away the smallest possible volume surrounding the fittings and 3D-printed them in a fraction of the time which otherwise would have taken hours and hours to find out.  
After measuring the results we could adjust the CAD-model correspondently and get perfect fittings when 3D-printing the final model.  
This procedure is perfect for testing overhangs, fittings, crucial dimensions, material consumption cost, etc.  
So in other words.... don't waste time and filament! :)

Remember to leave me a tip if you think that my work is great! As a student I really appreciate it!
Smart and cool way to tie your shoes fast.  
Why are Klöts better than normal shoelaces?  
It is faster way to tie your shoes.
They look personal and cool.
They will always stay at the same tension. (Super useful for sports)
There is no unnecessary ends of shoelaces hanging.
Fully customizable
!!! Remember to thread Klöts flat side pointing up. Curvy side will press against your shoe to make sure that shoelaces will pull Klöts away from each other not down. When the pull is away from each other it prevents Klöts open in action!!!  
There are 3 different models available:  
Klöts 3 - For small shoes and kids shoes
Klöts 4 - For average sized shoes
Klöts 5 - For big shoes and boots  
27.7.2015
Added strips to make Klöts look even cooler and more personal.  
How to use?  
Print Klöts (and strips)
(1.2 Super glue strips in place)
Undo your shoelaces
Thread shoelaces through Klöts
Make sure that the tension is right
In the end make really tight knots
Put the rest of your shoelaces into the shoes.

I designed this support to be compact and easy to print. Just print a couple of these and attach to a vertical surface (I used double-sided sticky tape) This model should fit most shoes but some scaling might be needed depending on your needs.
F360 model: https://a360.co/2LV794c
Tips:
If you want to use double-sided tape choose the type that is thicker and has like a soft foams core. I noticed this type of tape does not unstick after holding a lot of weight for some time.
For heavier shoes I recommend printing in ABS or PETG due to the tendency for PLA to deform permanently after a continuous load for a long time.

Summary
I created 2 different removable dividers for the box that separate it into 2 or 4 sections. They are the right height to place both dividers inside at the same time when giving it as a gift. I also created a box shaped floor panel that gives enough room on the sides to wrap around Velvet (what I used) or any material and glue it to the back side. I used a thick padding on the floor panel first and then used velvet material to go over (See last pictures above). When the floor panel is done, it will fit tightly in place as you push it evenly toward the floor. I put some hot glue in the bottom before I pushed the velvet floor panel down into place. Though it was so tight that the glue probably wasn't necessary. I also created a placard for the bottom of the lid so you could put a message or someone's name on it. I used some 5 minute epoxy to glue it to the lid. Yes, you could model the name right into the lid itself, but sometimes we like to have gifts printed first and ready to go before we know who we are even giving them too. So the placard makes the gift extra special and gives you flexibility to print the box before you know who the recipient is. This box and all pieces have already been scaled to what I thought was a nice sized jewelry box but you are free to scale it how you like. Though if you go smaller, I don't know how the divider pieces will do.
Now go make someone very happy!

Notes:
A Brim should be used for the divider pieces as they are thin and you may need better adhesion. I printed all pieces at 210 temp and 60 bed.
The heart shaped floor piece can be used as your template to cut out velvet or material to be wrapped around it. Remember to cut the fabric about 2 inches larger than the floor piece so you have enough to wrap around. I also cut slits in the fabric that extends beyond the heart shape so you can wrap the fabric and secure with hot glue in smaller sections at a time with less wrinkles.
Post-Printing
Printed with Hatchbox Wood
Light sanding until satisfied with the finish. Then I used a coat of Minwax Pro 'natural chestnut' wood stain. After the first coat dried I used a second coat of 'red mahogany'. After that dried I used a rag to wipe on hand rubbed polyurethane. For the colored lid inserts I used acrylic paint and an airbrush.

Summary
This is a remix of gaellafond's excellent Mini Floor Stands - Keep calm. 
It's very very similar to his design (all credits for the OpenSCAD file go to him!), only changes are:
The arm locking mechanism is such that gravity will lock it.
I increased the font size for the word ""and"" and made it configurable, too. Now it prints better for me.
Hinges are a bit tighter by default (Works well for well calibrated printers)
Thickness is a bit reduced by default.
I added a few more logos to choose from. New: I added Beer and Gin logos, as requested by CY357.
If you like it, also check out my configurable text based creations, multi-line label, gadget display stand, bunting banner, Fancy Nameplate, customizable text box III, Nameplate, pyramid text, name plate, Customizable text box with lid and round text. Have also a look at my configurable pack of dogs and rabbits. Or see the customizable filament swatches to have an overview over your material.
Thanks to Sergey Ershov for his multimedia icons etc which are used here. Also thanks to Oleg Turbaba for his iconoteka icons. Thanks go out to Instagram for their Glyph. Thanks to Shannon E. Thomas for his under the influence icons. Thanks to coffeebeanworks for the gin icon.
Have fun!

Okay, here it is..
The Detailed Town House Builder.   
Scale 1:50  
No supports needed to print.  
27-July-2015:  
We have published the first set of blocks to get you started.  
A complete sliding  window system, wall structure, exterior wall cladding and wall cap.   
We intend to release the entire Library of printable blocks for this series in 6 separate parts to help you concentrate on printing at the best quality possible. However we will only do that once we have had a minimum of 4 Makes per release.  
Our mission is to create the most detailed 3D High resolution printed house in the world and we would like you all to be part of this process.  
In the next release, we would be publishing interior cladding, conner walls and a detailed pivot door.  
Keep making and we will keep updating!  
Have fun printing!  
UPDATE 01 September 2015:  
Door detail added
Corner wall structure and interior cladding added
Door base and Corner wall cap added.
Go for it!!  
More to come.  
UPDATE 19 September 2015:    
Floor slabs and floor Beam structure added.  
Go for it!  
Note: You can print more brick walls and interior wall panels to clad open areas and also to increase the size of the building as this design is totally modular.  
Upper floor Modules coming soon.

Summary
The goal of this project is to design a cover for an 8mm⌀ extension cord at my makerspace, strong enough to walk on, at minimum cost. The parts assemble to form a rigid triangle, with the top in compression and the base in tension.
Filament usage: 170 g/m (52 g/ft)
Filament cost at $20/kg PLA: $3.40/m ($1.04/ft)
The STL files contain 100mm extrusions; you should scale them to the desired length.
For example, to span a distance of 1080 mm, you could print the following:
cord_cover_top_3x.stl, scaled to Z=180%, 3×2 copies: 180×3×2 = 1080 mm
cord_cover_base.stl, scaled to Y=180%, 5 copies: 180×5 = 900 mm
cord_cover_base.stl, scaled to Y=90%, 2 copies: 90×2 = 180 mm
When assembling, stagger the top and base parts like bricks, with 50% overlap.  The final base (would be #6 in this example) is split in half and positioned at the ends.
The top_1x and top_3x STLs are equivalent, but top_3x is theoretically less wobbly because the 3 parts can support each other.
I recommend printing 20mm extrusions first, for quality/strength testing:
cord_cover_top_1x.stl, scaled to Z=20%
cord_cover_base.stl, scaled to Y=20%
PrusaSlicer settings for 'top':
Scale in the Z direction
0.2 mm layer height
1 wall (wall+infill is stronger than all-walls)
100% rectilinear infill
0 top/bottom layers (let the infill handle it)
3-layer raft with 0.15 mm Z distance (bed adhesion is important)
Seam position: Random (print the horizontal stitches in both directions)
No support
PrusaSlicer settings for 'base':
Scale in the Y direction
0.2 mm layer height
2 walls
100% rectilinear infill
0 top/bottom layers (let the infill handle it)
No raft (the base is a huge rectangle)
No support
The ""8mm"" STLs have 8.1mm⌀ of internal clearance.  I haven't built STLs for other diameters, but they can be made in Fusion 360: Modify > Change Parameters > (wire_diameter, top_thick, extrusion_length)
Longprint is loooooooooong.

Summary
Pretty self explanatory, it's a vise to hold PCBs steady when you are soldering your components.
The ball joint design gives you a fair bit of movement to position your work where it is most comfortable.
The main drive screw has reverse threads on one side to make the jaws clamp your PCB right in the middle of the vise.
The base has a few square holes for magnets to keep it steady on your workbench.
The vise can hold PCBs with a maximum width of 10cm.
Instructions
The STLs are oriented the way I printed them on my Ultimaker and they were printed without a raft or support for minimum cleanup. The grooves of the jaws do need a bit of cleaning unless you've got retraction working well (I haven't bothered with that yet) but other than that the pieces should come out pretty much clean.
Please note that the threads are quite tight (at least on my print) and will require a bit of convincing the first few times. Add a bit of water to them to keep the heat down and work the pieces back and forth untill they work smoothly. I made them tight to minimise the flex in the jaws as you tighten them on your PCB.
The ""swivel"" and ""bracket"" parts have guide holes for short pieces of 3mm filament to aid alignment when gluing them together. I undersized the holes so you'll have to drill them out a bit if you decide to use them.
The main drive screw needs to be fairly solid or it will become too brittle. I first printed it with a 3.5mm fill spacing and then promptly dropped it on the floor which caused it to break in two...
Update 120427: Added pcb_vise_v2-drive_screw_2parts_left and right which is simply the drivescrew split into two parts to help vertically challenged printers :)
Update 120428: Added pcb_vise_v2-Bracket_2parts_bracket_left and -right (sorry about the long names, they help me keep track of all the parts). There weren't a hole lot of room to add in any alignment helpers here but I hope you can manage without them.

My Shop bought Sports roller was too long for my sports bag and it also would not roll on the floor for my foot. So I designed my own.
This Sports Roller will fit in your sports bag plus it can also roll on the floor to use with your feet when needed. The roller is very strong has a smooth roll action as it has 608 Bearings in the roller. As it is not to large it gets in to all those places your floor or larger roller cant.
There are two rollers to chose from, the Spiky (If your hard enough) shown in Orange and the Spheres shown in Purple.
If you print one please post a 'Make"" I would love to see some other colours etc.
I printed mine in ABS as that is supposed to be more resistant to oils and sports people could have oils etc.on them. I have been using mine for over a year now and it still works and looks like new. (The pictures are of my year old ones, not fresh off the printer ones)
Materials / Parts needed
Print 2x Handles
Print 2x End Screw Caps
Print 1x Roller (Either Spiky or Sphere)
Print 2x or 4x Washers (Depends on your printer and how stiff you want the roller)
Extra Parts Needed available at most hardware stores
1x Steel 8mm threaded rod, 320mm long
2x M8 Steel Nuts
2x 608 Bearings
Assemble as shown in the exploded view picture.
The Handle is not threaded but still screws on to the steel threaded bar, It locks in tighter once the bar gets to the M8 nuts at each end.
The bearings and the M8 Nuts might need a good push to get them in.

Cable / wire floor protector cover is designed to add multiple sections by snapping them together. This allows you to cover a large area on the floor to protect cables from being walked on.
It will print under most settings. You can print it like normal (as it would sit on the floor) without using supports, assuming you are ok with a slightly rougher under side where the cables go. The filament will successfully bridge the gap after 2-3 layers. This leaves a slightly rougher under side where the cables rest, but this is hidden anyway so does not affect the aesthetics. It will also print on its side for those with large vertical 3D print areas.
Dimensions:  190 mm length (+7 mm snap-on connector) x 40 mm width x 11 mm height

How I Designed This
Summary
Inspired by OpenForge's tiles, these flooring tiles add a sci-fi flavor to your game. Designed to the 1 inch (25.4mm) scale of the OpenLock and OpenForge tile systems.
The grilled tile is for the industrial sites around the universe, with a single broken tile is included for any alien infestations.
How I Designed This
Details
These tiles are designed to use the OpenForge Magnetic bases (links below) as a foundation. Use the OpenForge 2.0 City Street Bases or OpenForge 2.0 Dungeon Stone Bases, with the appropriate scale (101.6% in the X and Y axes).
I used the profile from 3D Printed Table Top for my printer's settings
Note: The Broken Grill will need supports and they tend to damage it a little. So be careful when snipping the supports away.

*** Update (26/09/2017): New thing files added:
Arms with three different sizes: 100, 140 and 200 mm
New arm type: mixed arm design (hole at one end and a stud at the other). With this you can extend the reach of the lamp one arm at a time (rather than needing a pair of arms). This may replace the other two types of arms (male and female).
*** Update (31/03/2019): New thing files added:
Double lamp holder, lamp cap, lamp cap with button, wire holder, g-clamp mounting, clip mounting and tube mounting.

Having good lighting at your desk or at a reading location is essential for your visual comfort and the health of your eyes. Although, it is not always possible to find a lamp of your liking, or that does not occupy much space on your desk, limiting your work area. In project I made a 3D printed articulating lamp, which can be configured according to your needs.
Possibly the final product will be more expensive than ordinary lamps that you will find in stores. But none will be configurable like this, nor will will let you be proud to say that you did it by yourself! If you have a 3D printer or have access to one in your hacker/maker space, this is an interesting and useful project to equip your workshop and practice your 3D printing and modeling skills.
Adapted from Kenneth awesome Articulating, Wall-Mounted, Magnetic Phone Mount design into an articulating wall mounted LED lamp.

Be careful when working with electricity. Make sure there is no short circuit and just try to connect to the electrical power plug after making sure that all components are properly connected and double insulated. If you don't have enough experience working with electricity, as for others help.
Don't touch any exposed wire or any metal part of the LED lamp after it's energized! Some LED spots have a metal heat sink. Avoid touching that part when the lamp is on!
Once there are exposed wires, it's not recommend to use it places accessible to children or animals. Under no circunstances use it close to wet surfaces!
It's and experimental design, so you might use it with caution.

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5903683
I made a mushroom night lamp based on the small mushroom I made before: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4978281
It's easy to assemble, without screws(maybe need a little glue to stick the 9 caps on the head). I recommend LED light（less than 3.5W) with E27 holder for this lamp.
Thank you for loving it! :)

Summary
For me, what makes 3D printing so awesome is not just that you can make things yourself that you would have otherwise bought, but that you can make things that couldn't be made any other way. For this reason, I've been captivated by captured joints, where moving parts are printed together such that no assembly is required. 
This lampshade consists of 14 interlocking pieces printed at once. When you pull up on the top, the blossom opens, allowing more light out. See the video here: http://youtu.be/blEgWG9V9sA
This lamp is my entry into ProtoParadigm's Winter Wonderland Contest, since when I'm struggling through a long, dark, Northwest winter, what I need is light and a reminder that the blossoms of spring will eventually arrive. I was inspired by http://www.mgxbymaterialise.com/limited-editions/mgxmodel/detail/detail/71, but I wanted to make a simpler, more organic model that wouldn't require a powder printer. 
Instructions
Choose one of the lampshades; the black one is Lamp_Opaque and the green one is Lamp_Translucent, which has a thin, solid inner surface instead of the grillwork, to act as a light diffuser when using translucent plastic.
Print the lampshade and the stand. I sliced them with Slic3r, which worked great. Make sure you have good retraction. I printed everything you see on my Replicator 1 in PLA at 120 mm/s using the Sailfish firmware. I print on unheated blue painters tape, which kept everything well adhered to the build platform.
When the lampshade is finished printing, remove it from the platform and carefully push up on the bottom center parts while pulling down on the outer ring. You may need to slice a few strings between the petals to allow them to separate. Once you get it open all the way, exercise it a few times and cut out any remaining strings. It should move quite freely. 
The stand is made to accept a standard hollow, threaded rod that lamps are often mounted with (at least in the US). You just need to find a small lamp socket and cord to attach. I used a standard candelabra socket and an LED bulb. You can use anything, so long as it's less than 34mm in diameter. I recommend LEDs, since they are low power and so won't soften the plastic. However, small LED bulbs are strangely hard to find. Of course, you could always make your own.
Once you install the bulb, slip the shade down over it and press it into the stand (it's just a conical press-fit). This way you can pry the shade back off to change the bulb. 
The bottom of the stand is solid so that you can pour sand in if you're worried about it tipping over. The holes in the stand are designed to encourage cooling airflow past the bulb. I'm also trying something new: I signed my name to the bottom of the stand. When my dad was a potter, he always stamped his name on the bottom of his pots, so I thought I would try the same thing. I'm interested to hear if any of you have comments on this method of attribution.

Saw these for the first time in Thailand a couple years ago but they cost $30 for even the simplest.  Now you can print your own!  
Three STLs uploaded are 5cm tall, 10cm tall, and 15cm tall giving you your baby, mama, and papa lamp shades.  Yeah, have fun printing 30 of those 15cm pieces!  First one to do so gets a pat on the back.  
Scale the parts to your liking for different sizes and piece thickness.  
I also added DXF files for diversity  
UPDATE:
My favorite results so far for the 30 piece sphere have been with a 125 mm size printed with two .25mm layers and 4 perimeters, so I've uploaded this one as well.

http://bit.ly/11hMEON
Or get creative and figure out your own...  
Print the required number in any color or combination of colors you like, print, and then have fun figuring out how to put them together.  You might break a few the first few tries.  
I would suggest only printing with ABS because the only thing you would get out of printing these with PLA is frustration and disappointment (parts have to be pretty flexible).  But go ahead, prove me wrong.  
The thickness of the STLs are 0.6mm, but they can easily be scaled to your liking using netfabb or similar.  I printed 3 layers at 0.2mm, but please feel free to play around with different thicknesses and layer combinations and tell me what you like best!  
After you've put together all but the last few pieces of it, stick it on a hanging lantern cord or whatever you like, add the final pieces, and hang it up!  (Hint: try different combinations of plastic colors and light bulb colors.  Red shade with green bulb??? Trippy maaaan)

Summary
Inspired by the geometry of an artichoke and Louis Poulsen's great lighting studies and diagrams. This beautiful lamp shade  is perfect for the home or business. You can use any standard hanging light cord and a low temp bulb (such as a cfl bulb.) We purchased a standard lamp base with a 12 ft cord from amazon and it screws in the top hole with no issues.  
40% infill, high cooling, slow speed. May be tricky on some printers so you may need support for some of the lower fins.  
Notes:
The model was created in 3ds Max 2011 but due to the inch/mm unit issues the model is scaled up by 2540%.
Check out http://www.gcreate.com for information on our Large Format gMax 1.5 + 3D Printers
Instructions
The file was made in 3ds Max 2011. We started with two sets of fins offset by 30 degrees. These fins were designed to hide the light source while allowing for reflected light. The profiles were also created to allow for printing on an FFF printer.  
After several passes at the perfect shape, the entire model was arrayed radially to create the full lamp shade. We finished by using a boolean union to make it manifold.

Lampe is a fully 3D printed and customizable lamp. 
The minimal design doesn't need support material to be printed and it can be combined with exotic materials to get a premium result. The models were 3D printed with Colorfabb Woodfill (body) and White nGen (lamp screen). 
There are two main versions of Lampe: regular version (centered light bulb and lamp screen connector) and minimal version (light bulb on the top part and no lamp screen). Also, there are three lamp screen designs (vertical, horizontal and square) which can be shortened or enlarged to get different shapes and lamp sizes.
The Lampe Collection is fully 3D printed, no screws or glue are needed during the assembly process, and it can be printed in nearly any printer (120x120x120 printing surface, heated bed not necessary). 
The original design uses a 29mm diameter E14 light bulb fitting, but as the diameter can vary depending on where you buy it, it may be necessary to modify the diameter.
IMPORTANT: I strongly recommend to use E14 LED light bulbs, in order to avoid any heat or size problem. It's really important for you to check if the light bulb gets warm, as it may deform the lamp (it always depends if you use PLA, ABS or any other material). For the pictures I used the vertical lamp screen combined with a colour changing LED light bulb with remote controller (available online for less than 8€). I'm not responsible for any damage or compatibility issue.
The lamp body and connector can be printed with thick walls and no infill. The lamp screens need to be printed without bottom or top walls, 0% infill and with one perimeter (0.4mm wall, 0.1 layer height and the lowest printing temperature possible to avoid combing). The lamp screen connects to the screen frame applying some pressure, no glue or screws are needed.
I hope you enjoy the design and feel free to improve it.

***06/12/2017 - Getting requests for smaller sizes. I have changed minimum Bicep size from 160 to 110, but cannot make the hand smaller! 135 is the minimum for two reasons. Firstly the safety of the children (choking on small parts), and tolerance/weakness of small pins.
***17/07/2017 - Receiving feedback that the pins are too long to insert in cuff tensioner box easily. The Cuff minimum has been reset to 65mm to fix.
***14/03/2017 - Update v2.1 Rounded cuff edges, refined palm. Version / Measurement A B C / Hand scale% now stamped on underneath of cuff for reference.
Team UnLimibited are very proud to release version 2.0 of their UnLimbited arm design; named the Alfie Edition after it's first recipient.
The UnLimbited Arm 2.0 is fully parametric and customisable using Thingiverse Customiser to produce all the files correctly scaled based on a recipients real world measurements.
This is the next generation deviced based upon the popular 1.7 Isabella edition that was released last year as found here :- http://www.teamunlimbited.org/the-unlimbited-arm/

Introduction
The Unlimbited Arm V2.1 - Alfie Edition is the successor to the previous Isabella Edition arm released by Team UnLimbited last year.
Key Features :-
Arm is now 100% Parametric and can be scaled to ANY recipient size, with only constraint now being print plate size (were working on fixing that as well) 
Using real world recipient measurements Thingiverse customiser will generate ALL required components pre-scaled to recipients size.
Massively simplified workflow to build an arm.
1 - Measure recipient
2 - Use Customiser
3 - Download components
4 - Print
5 - Assemble
6 - e-NABLE the Future !
Taking Recipient Measurements
In order to build and UnLimibited Arm the following measurements are required.
The length of the NON-AFFECTED hand as measured from the wrist to the end of the longest finger. Shown in the Diagram as measurement C.
The length of the NON-AFFECTED forarm as measured from the inside fold of the elbow to the wrist. Shown in the Diagram as measurement B.
The circumference of the AFFECTED upper arm, measured from the middle of the upper arm; Shown in the Diagram as measurement A. TAKE NOTE thats the AFFECTED arm you are building a device for not the NON-AFFECTED arm the other measurements are taken from.
Using Customizer
Now that you have the measurements for the device you need use customiser (from the button on the right of this page)
Enter the measurements into customiser using the drop down box and the slide bars and click Create Thing.
Once processes in ""My Things"" section you will be able to access and download all the files you need for your generated UnLimbited Arm.
N.B. If previewing the Phoenix hand elements of the arm you will not see these scale in the preview box, but trust us the end files will be re-scaled as per your measurements.
Assembly
Assembly of the arm is the same process as that of the 1.7 Isabella edition, using thermo-forming. This has been previously covered in our 1.7 video and is provided below.
Why We Do This
Below is a video showing why we do this, using 3D printing to bring smiles to those with a limb difference.
Why others do it
Please see a video about a 10 year old boy called Henio from Poland his arm was produced by Krzysztof Grandys who created this arm using this thingiverse design and customiser.

Hello all,
I have generated a full set of arm armor for Mando. I built the armor to cosplay ""The Mandalorian"" and decided to share with everyone. It is pretty darn close to the actual thing. I may be updating it from time to time.
I appreciate everyone's support. Please post your makes! I like the feedback.
Downloads include both left and right shoulder (Pauldron), arm (Vambrace), and hand (Guantlet) armor, with Mudhorn signet and Whistling Birds.
Mando'ade darasuum.

Summary
Ball and socket system, upgraded with a quarter turn twist lock on each ball joint to greatly increase pullout strength.  
My idea is to create a ball and socket system that is not only 3d printable but extremly strong and will not pop apart easily.  This would be suitable for things like an LED lamp arm or heavy duty alligator clip where you don't want the neck popping apart.  
My original project was posted on hackaday:
https://hackaday.io/project/5739-locking-ball-and-socket-gooseneck-system  
Update 5/17/15
New STL files posted on 5/17/15 - should work much better on printers with larger layer height / lower resolution
Instructions
PRINTING
I printed the parts with socket up, this minimizes supports that are placed inside the socket, easier to remove from the ball.  
I printed with a layer resolution of .01"" or .25mm.  For larger layers you should be fine, if you have any issues post them in the comments.  
Use a fairly dense infill if you want these to be nice and strong.  The intent is for this to make a fairly heavy duty gooseneck arm.  
ASSEMBLY
Place nut over ball joint first before snapping socket onto ball.  
Snap socket onto ball, requires moderate amount of force.  
Slide nut onto socket, take care to align the locking features.  
Twist quarter turn to lock in place. Small hex flats are 10mm, large hex flats on the twist-lock nut are 19mm.  
Repeat for additional joints.

UPDATE 11/18/18 10:22 PM MT
WE DID IT!!!!!! 1000 collections, 30000 views, and over 8000 downloads! Woohoo! Thank you, everyone, who have commented, liked, downloaded, remixed, and suggest alterations for this idea. You guys are the best and the ones that keep me going! Thank you so much, Thingiverse community.
UPDATE 9/27/17: I added Creality_CR10_Extended_Extruder_Arm_2 and it should be more accurate to the original
I find the extruder arm for the Creality Cr-10 to be too short and the spring too strong for my weak and scrawny ""muscles."" So, being the nerd that I am, I use science and 3D printing to solve an issue. This extended arm should give you enough leverage to easily open the arm.
Print at 100% infill for maximum strength and decreased chances of snapping.
Note: This may wear out over time and may require reprinting and installation more frequently. This is not made to be a permanent replacement for the existing arm.
Please post makes!

The Scissor Snake Family
WINNER Second Runner-Up Support-free Product Design Christmas 2014 MyMiniFactory.com. Now on Thingiverse by popular demand.
The ""Scissor Snake"" is a fun 3D printed toy. It is easy to print without support; the ""Scissor Snake"" comes off the build plate assembled and ready to use. Its motion is incredibly smooth, resulting in a very precise, fast, durable and fun remote grabber.
This design uses an exclusive, support-less crossover bearing, engineered for the project. The cross-over bearing interlocks with the frame when fully extended under load, causing the frame to become rigid, thereby reducing stress on the bearing pivots. This results in a strong and durable toy cable of lifting many times its own weight. Kid tested. Guaranteed to provide many hours of fun for kids of all ages.
Buy a 3D printed Scissor Snake here. ricswika.com
Other members of the Scissor Snake Family
(The annoying fused sections in Super, Magnum and Curvy are now FIXED in RevA.... many thanks to TLC510 for letting me know about the problem. Please accept my apology for the error.)
Mini - Use as a test print to calibrate your crossover bearing for no fusing and tight motion
Scissor - The Classic scissor snake, easy to print and a good size for kids
Super - Once you have it dialed in, this one can be a lot of fun; it little more challenging to print. This is the longest Scissor Snake,
Magnum a.k.a. the Trouser Snake - Another kind of Scissor Snake.
Curvy (Experimental, needs tweaking) - Forms an ""S"" curve when extended
Corner (Experimental, needs tweaking) - Forms a curve when extended, to snake around a corner
Instructions
Print at 100% scale, using 30% to 50% infill, no support, at 0.2mm layer height. The ""Scissor Snake"" is designed to print at 100% scale on a wide range of 3D printers. However, if the print comes out looser than you'd like, you can reduce the scale by 5 to 10%; this will produce tighter joints. If the print comes out too tight, increase the scale by 5 to 10%; this will produce looser joints. Normally this is not necessary. Otherwise, for best results, don't change the scale of the model.

This is the low-cost prototype of a robotic arm with 6 DOF, 3D printers manufactured and designed using free software (OpenScad, Inksape..).
Instructions
You only have to print all parts and mount it with the instructions. Download the assembly instructions file and start it to mount.
if you want see how  work , click here!
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnvWSHTnrqo&feature=plcp
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNnTyrpuFUY&feature=plcp
The file ""robot arm printable.rar"" contains all the files of OpenScad and .stl, ready to print.
The other file ""robotic arm_freeCAD.rar"" contains the  robotic arm already mounted in FreeCAD
All the information that you need to control the robotic arm is in the file ""Guide,PCB_and_control_programs.rar"". It's contains the guide about all the caracteristics of the robotic arm and the process that you have to follow to calibrate it with the control's programs. All the information is in spanish, there isn't an english version. 
The hardware that use is Arduino UNO, to read the position of the servos, you need make a PCB ( if only want move it, you don't need create the PCB) because have the signals multiplexed. The planes are in the same file of the control's programs. To open the planes, you need have OrCAD Layout to the PCB and OrCAD Capture CIS for the schematic of conection. 
Another partner (http://www.thingiverse.com/CarlosRZambrana) was created a simulator to control the robotic arm , with three modes of funcionality, one mode of control is  with a gamepad. I still haven't got the programs but I will upload this in the future  when he pass me all the files to upload it. You can see the simulator in the pictures. If you want the simulator's files, you can wait my upload or send a message to CarlosRZambrana to get it, or ask him all doubt that you have about the simulator).
you can download the gripper from: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7109

A gripper compatible with a mini servo I used the Topline ES-05 JR, I milled it with a 3-axis cnc machine but its also printable. Made of 4mm hardboard.
A little video:

For more pictures and info:
http://jjshortcut.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/my-mini-servo-grippers-and-completed-robotic-arm/
Instructions
To assemble the gripper you use m3 nuts and bolts. For the gripper parts you use nylock nuts so the gripper wont come loose. For more grip use some kind of soft foam which you glue on the grip parts with super glue. For connecting the horn of the servo to the right gear part use some small screws, like 2mm.

I designed this arm because i needed a flexible way to handle the RasPi Cam and a 24V led strip. The idea is based on this  design ""locking ball and socket arm"" https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:824711 by alexrich82.
The mount can be fixed to the Ender 3 printer between lcd screws and the frame as shown in the photos.
You can print as many joint as you want in order to fit your needs and if you find the connection a little too loose just add a piece of tape on the surface of every sphere. I did it and the result was very good.
The box for the Camera remains closed due to interference and the led stand is not mandatory for the strength of the structure. 
I use a 30cm ribbon cable to connect the camera to the raspberry fixed to the frame with this project of mine: Ender 3 Raspberry Pi 2/3 mount
As always any suggestion on how to improve it is very welcome.
If you have any doubt, do not hesitate to contact me, I'll try my best to help you.
If you like what I do and want to support me, head to https://www.paypal.me/giacomo30196 every bit helps me to make more things for you.

An 100% printable phone arm!
It weighs about 0.25 kg and is easy to assemble.
Each arm has a working length of 150 mm, so the 3 of them provide a total length of 450mm.
There are 10 different parts.
All of them were printed with 30% infill in PLA, apart from the ""Base Screw Pad"", which was printed with 50% infill in a flexible material for better grip (TreeD Flexmark 9). It is a hard TPU, which is easily printed without any modifications in Creality Ender 3.
60% infill may be a better option for your screws.
Below you can find some screenshots from Cura, to see how I suggest you to print the parts.
The ""Arm End"" is printed separately from the ""Arm"" in order to avoid warping in the thread section. It needs some force to put ""Arm End"" into the ""Arm"". If it is not possible to fit, try to sand the base of the outer cylindrical surface of the ""Arm End"". 
The first time (or two) that you are going to use the screws, there is going to be some resistance but after that they should work properly.

I really enjoyed this Leg Lamp design. I wanted to make it a little easier to print so I removed the base in tinker cad and designed a new base and lamp shade to separate out the parts to utilize different color filaments.
On my i3 clone I printed everything at 130%.
The leg is printed with a brim to increase build plate adhesion. Print it with 0% infill to run a wire. I used 3 perimeter layers and drilled the bottom of the shoe and top of the leg to pass the electrical wire. 
There are two lamp shades. Either one should be printed as is. The center of the shade contains a 16mm diameter mount for one 3-led length of 5050 strip LED's. Print the lamp shade with 25% infill or as you see fit for your printer.
The base prints upside down making the entire project not require supports. Print with 25% infill or as you see best fit for your printer.
Edit 12/1/2018 - I uploaded a different base. Prints a bit faster.

Loved the LED Bridge by Opossums (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1639224) but wanted to add my own touch and make it simple and easy to print.
There are only 4 different parts to print that do not need supports.
I made the channel for the LED strip 12mm wide to fit all. I will also be doing updated designs of the base in future so keep checking back here! The whole bridge is just over 1 meter wide.
This light is great as it leaves virtually no shadows... which also means its awesome for filming whats happening on your desk... Enter the GoPro Mount! https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2828648 see my remix for more details...

Print all parts as are in the pictures. Pegs will need a little sand to help them fit. My bridge was printed in ICE filament's PET 2.85mm translucent blue from Amazon. In all, at 0.2mm layer height, it took around 35 hours to print.
I used a standard 12v LED light strip off amazon and recycled an old 240-12v power supply inline with a Sonoff Wifi switch.

Leg levelers for IKEA Lack table or anything with a 50mm square leg.  I printed them at .30 layer height with petg and they work fine.  They provide a maximum adjustment of 10-11 mm per leg.
I have also included a wrench to help with the adjustment if you need it.  I was able to do it with my fingers just fine but if I had a wrench that size I would have used it for sure.  
Update 3-22-19: I did print the wrench and it works very well.  It's admittedly a little loose fitting but still works great and isn't a waste of time and plastic to print.  I am glad I have it now for when I move my Lack enclosure.  It makes adjustment way easier.

Adjust the infill and resolution to your taste. I can't remember what infill percentage I actually used when I made them so I guessed at 20%. The wrench was printed with 20% cubic infill + 3 perimeters and was plenty stiff.

How I Designed This
Summary
I noticed my Ikea Lack table was a bit wobbly, so I designed this bracket.
You will need 4 brackets in total, one for each leg. They are designed for size 6 screws, with enough holes for 7 in each bracket, which is definitely overkill, so you can probably get away with fewer.
I have included models that have the following on each hole:
-An 82 degree countersink, designed for standard wood screws.
-A more shallow countersink, designed for drywall screws.
-No countersink, designed for normal pan head screws.
These brackets paired with a foam mat below the table have reduced vibration caused by the printer almost entirely.

The other day one of our best friends had knee surgery. I created this model so he can point out to all of us what bits he had replaced...  
He's doing very well btw... and was really happy with the print.
Instructions
Just print straight out... no support should be necessary (the kneecap is a bit less round than it should be to make it easier to print). So the entire thing is a bit of an ""artistic interpretation"", but close enough for it's purpose.  
I disabled the floor layers in my print so you can see the honeycomb fill pattern from the bottom... shows people what's inside the print.. which they seem to like (and I certainly do).

If necessity is the mother of invention, then broken parts are the mother of Thingiverse uploads.
The included STLs are for 3 of the keyboards I had in my office.
And you should be able to customize the design for many other keyboards if you have calipers handy to measure the existing leg/foot.
Print Settings
Supports:
Yes
Notes:
SCAD file is included for customization, and in case you have a keyboard that doesn't fit this basic design. (and if yours doesn't fit the design - let me know the details so I can update this model)
This will need supports for the arm knobs, and possibly for the rounded ends (depends on your printer and material).
The ABS I tried was too soft (YMMV).
PLA and PETG worked really well.
Most SLA acrylic resins are too fragile, but some ""tough"" and ""high tensile strength"" resins have worked decently.

This is just my version of the Helping Hands - soldering station. It measures 188x188mm (7-3/8""x7-3/8""). I used the 1/4PT Flexible Oil Coolant Pipes with 13mm diameter threads that can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/ycfsypjb
My smaller, 140x140mm version can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3136206
The alligator clips can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/yag5kgft
The magnifying glass was purchased from my local Ace Hardware store.
You'll need to enlarge the small hole in the end of the hose for the clips to fit, a little hot glue keeps them from coming out while in use. I used some silicone fuel tubing to cover the ends of the clips.
The holes in the base are threaded and I recommend putting a little hot glue in the holes to keep the arms from loosening up while in use. This is designed to be printed on a 200x200mm bed or larger. If you'd like something similar but smaller please leave a comment.

Summary
The T-Rex Skull from MakerBot Academy comes complete with a lesson plan that explores characteristics of the most-studied dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus Rex.  
With this 3D printable model, students will understand what can be learned from fossils and in doing so, acknowledge the difference between scientific facts and theories.  
Download and print the entire T-Rex Skeleton.
Standards
NGSS
CCSS
Overview and Background
**Overview**  
No matter how lengthy its name, many children can name a dinosaur on sight. This lesson goes beyond naming dinosaurs and will give students a broader understanding of how we know about dinosaurs.  

In the first part of the lesson, students will discuss what they know about lions. Then they will do the same for a *Tyrannosaurus Rex*. While the comparison is a stretch, it demonstrates what we know as fact and what we know as theory.   

As students discuss the T. rex, they will learn that fossils tell a story about the animal. They describe facts (how tall, how wide, what kind of teeth) and ideas (what the T. rex might have eaten, how fast it may have moved due to its leg structure, or how it may have hunted).  

The other part of the lesson covers how fossils are formed. The purpose is to identify conditions necessary for fossilization. Because students will go over this information in the first part of the lesson, this exercise allows them to construct their own storyboard imagining the circumstances for another animal to become fossilized.  


**Learning Objectives**  
Students will understand what can be learned from fossils and know the difference between facts and theories. They will also gain a general understanding of how fossils are formed.  
Lesson Plan and Activity
**The T. rex Skull**  
Understanding fossils: An introduction to paleontology  

**Day 1: Introduction**  
List facts about the lion and other living animals. List things on the board, such as: size, speed, diet, teeth, mane, tail, etc.  

Ask students, *What would we know about this animal if it were extinct?* Discuss that only the hard parts (bones and teeth) are preserved as fossils. Then ask students to choose those things listed on the board that indicate what we would know about the lion if all we had were fossilized bones and teeth. Circle appropriate things on the board that are listed, then make a list of guesses.  
  
Ask students what do we know about fossilized animals. Pass around the MakerBot T. rex Skull and photos of the dinosaur, and invite the students to interpret it with both facts and guesses.  

Have the class draw muscles and skin on the T. rex. Discuss how imagination comes into the interpretation of fossils.  

You will have discussed fossilization with your students when doing the activity. Now, emphasize the discussions and the activity. On the board, make two columns. Title one, *What we know about dinosaurs*. The other should be titled, *What we have to guess*.  

---  

Then pose these questions:  
  * How do we know what we know about dinosaurs? (review what was just discussed about lions and the T. rex: that bones can tell the size of the animal, its running ability, what kind of teeth it had).  
  * What are things that we have to guess about? (While fossils may tell exactly what kind of teeth an animal has, we have to guess about what it might have eaten).   
  * Mention colorings of the T. rex. Point out that we must guess dinosaur colors because fossils do not tell us what color they were.  

The most famous dinosaur fossil of our time is Sue, the T. rex displayed at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. While your students may already know about Sue, this will get your students excited about the lesson.   

---  

Invite your students to visit All About Sue (http://archive.fieldmuseum.org/sue/index.html#sues-significance).   

Tell students to read through each of the tabs. They can record their answers to these questions on a piece of paper:  

  * What do we know about Sue? (Statistics, skull size, number of bones, where it was discovered, etc) List responses on the board.  
  * How do we know all of these things? (Students will likely answer bones or fossils)  
  * What is the significance of finding Sue? (It is the most complete T. rex skeleton ever).  
  * How do we know this? (Students should know that this is apparent through prior knowledge of other fossils and a comparison of Sue to other T. rex fossils  


---  

The following questions will help you gauge what students know about fossils in general before starting the lesson.  

  * What is a fossil? (Many students will answer bones, which is fine, but ask them if things like dinosaur eggs, or even nests, are considered fossils. Trace fossils include eggs, nests, tracks, and impressions.  
  * How do fossils form? (Though students may be very familiar with dinosaurs, they may not know the process that preserves the bones. If students cannot answer the question, that is fine. They will learn in this lesson.  
  * What can fossils tell us? (Here, you can lead the students. Remind them of all the things we know about Sue).  

---  

**Day 2: How do fossils form?**  
Now that students understand what can fossilize, ask them how it fossilizes. Students can visit *How Fossils Form* on Zoom Dinosaurs (http://www.zoomschool.com/subjects/dinosaurs/dinofossils/Fossilhow.html). Students will need to scroll down the page to get to the relevant text.  

Discuss the main points of the process:  

  * An animal must get buried fairly quickly.  
  * Why must it be buried quickly? (If it does not it would get eaten by scavengers).  
  * How might it be buried? (It could be buried by volcano or mudslide).  
  * Water helps bury the animal in sediment (The burial process is crucial. It is also why many animals do NOT get fossilized. Discuss the probability of these circumstances being just right).  
  * Soft parts decay.  
  * Sediment presses down and sand hardens to rock forming a fossil.  

---  

Challenge students to draw their own diagrams demonstrating the process of fossilization with whatever animal they like. They should describe things mentioned above. Remind them that water could sweep over an animal and bury it in a flash flood or severe storm, and that entire skeletons rarely form because things get carried away.   

After students finish their diagrams, tell them to pretend they are in the shoes of a paleontologist (a person who studies dinosaur fossils). Students can:  

  * Pretend they work in a museum and they have just finished piecing together a nearly complete T. rex.  
  * Describe the dinosaur and, based on the fossil find, tell a story about its life.  
  * Use what we know about living animals to come up with ideas about the T. rex. Back their ideas by what they have found in the fossils.  
 * Encourage them to be creative. Remind them to use phrases like, *This T. rex may have* or *the fossil evidence suggests*.   

---   

**Day 3: Uncovering the Facts**  
This activity will be a guided discovery. Have students return to the T. rex page on Zoom Dinosaurs (http://www.zoomschool.com/subjects/dinosaurs/dinofossils/). Explain that they will be T. rex fact finders, but that they have to find details that support the facts.  

Students will use their imagination to generate ideas based on these facts. This exercise can either be done as a group or individually, once students understand what they are looking for.  

As a model, find the first few facts with students and discuss the support. Then further the discussion with ideas. For example, students will find the following in the Anatomy section of the introduction page.  

---  

  * **FACT**: T. rex had tiny arms, each with two fingers. Ask students how paleontologists know about T. rex arms.  
  * **SUPPORT**: By studying the fossil bone structure of the T. rex, paleontologists can see what the different parts of the body looked like.  
  * **IDEA**: T. rex may have used its short arms to hold prey while biting it. However, this would depend on whether T. rex is a hunter or scavenger. If he were a scavenger, the prey would not be struggling.  

The following facts can be found on that same introduction page (http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/dinosaurs/dinos/trex/index.shtml):  

  * **FACT**: T. rex had a slim, stiff, pointed tail.  
  * **SUPPORT**: Fossil bones show the tail and its shape. The way bones are structured show that it was stiff.  
  * **IDEA**: The tail may have been used for balance, allowing for quick turns while running. The tail can be compared to that of living animals tail to learn about balance, but this is not necessarily a fact. We cannot know for certain because there is no proof that T. rex ran.  

---  

As a class or individually, have the students continue going through the T. rex pages looking for facts and support. Many facts with support can be found within the following headings:  

  * Introduction  
  * Skeleton  
  * What T. rex ate  
  * Hunting, fighting  
  * Intelligence, Care of Young  
  * Running  
  * Disease in T. rex  
  * T. rex myths  
  * Extinction  

While not necessary to cover every fact, try to discuss a few from each heading. This activity allows students to gain an understanding of the type of information that can be concluded from fossils, as well as discover that not all facts are believed to be 100% accurate.  

---   

**Questions to discuss:**  
  * What kind of information can scientists find out by studying animal fossils?  
  * What can the skeletal structure tell? (How an animal moved, how bones fit together)  
  * How can paleontologists group together certain dinosaurs?  
  * What sort of current knowledge can help us learn about extinct fossils? (By looking at animals today, we can make comparisons).  
  * What do your students think is needed for ideas to become facts?  
Materials Needed
  1. One computer with connection to the Internet; one MakerBot Replicator 2 Desktop 3D Printer.   
  2. The T-Rex Skull 3D files.  
  3. Paper, pencils, poster boards, markers.  
Duration of Lesson
3-5 Class Periods
Rubric and Assessment
Students can use information from the lesson to construct a T. rex trading cards. This model can be designed by hand or on a computer. On the front, a picture of the T. rex. On the back, specific facts about the T. rex. Cards should also include explanations for why the facts are believed to be true. Students can then trade these cards, explaining to their peers what facts they deemed important and why.

I have always enjoyed the Christmas Story movie, especially the leg lamp scene.  I figured someone must have designed a printable version, and sure enough a search produced 2 designs I liked.

Notes:
Add brim to leg to make sure it stays attached to print table. Printed leg at 0.1mm height for better ""curves"" and hollow for light to shine without structure showing. Printed leg in white PLA and colored the shoe red with a Sharpie marker even though the shoe was black in the movie, I wanted it to stand out from the black base.
Print the shade low density to allow light through, I printed 5%. I used 0.3mm height. Update: I printed the larger one labeled 130 and I prefer that scale and size for this print. I've added a picture and made it the cover photo, also, I added a picture of the smaller one on top for comparison.
Printed the base at 20%, 0.3mm height, but you can print how you best see fit. The base prints standing up to allow the pins to print correctly. I printed without supports and it came out fine.
I remixed the leg and lamp shade to allow them to hold 2 LED's, pictured. Got them off Amazon. I had to cut off the loop attachment on top of the LED's to get them to fit.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JSHX4S6/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I couldn't figure out how jetpuf's design attached the leg to the base, so I modeled some pins into the base and then some hollow cutouts in the bottom of the foot on the leg.
My design software is the basic XYZmaker that comes with the printer, so hopefully the files will work for you.
Finally, I replicated both size shades that jetpuf included, the 130 size being bigger.
Merry Christmas everyone and hope you enjoyed this as much as I did printing and putting in my front window to tease my wife and kids!!

2x m5 x10 socket head cap screw
5x m5 nuts
Instructions
Press a 5 mm nut into the bottom of the base leg.
Insert a 5 mm nut into the center of the base leg.
Put a 5 mm nut onto the 45 mm bolt and tighten to the head of the bolt. ( See picture.)
Press the bolt head and nut into the foot.
File 2 corners of two  5 mm nuts (see picture) and slide into the slots of the extrusions.
Install the leg onto the bottom of machine with the 5 mm socket head cap screws.
Thread the foot and the bolt into the leg.
I tapped the vertical extrusion with a 5 mm tap so the 45 mm bolt would thread into the extrusion to give
extra strength because I have a large heavy printer  
you can use a 35 mm bolt if you don't want to tap the extrusion.
and then you are done

These are downloaded from the life science 3D database at http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/?lng=en  
I only ran them through netfabb studio to clean up some errors and orient them correctly for 3D printing, any and all rights remain with the original source.  
These are full size, so you will probably need to scale them for printing.  I used 45% to fit the femur diagonally on my Printrbot Plus.  They'll need to be printed with support.

A remix of flameblade's Crest of Hyrule.  
I wanted a standing version of this print, but didn't want to print it standing up. The details of this lovely design come out much better if you print it on it's backside so I opted to make the supports separate bits.  
I didn't think it was much of a change compared to this overall awesome design, BUT flameblade still noticed :). & I'm not stingy, so rather than have him attempt to redo the work, I'm posting the edit up for all.  
It will stand up without the bits, but tips quite easily. If your display surface is unstable or not level you can print these small leg bits to keep it firmly planted!  
.. of course.. there's always double-sided tape ;)

This is a recreation of a sculpture by 'Bobby Duke Arts' on YouTube.
The print might be a little difficult to balance, so I would suggest either printing the lower piece with a higher infill percentage to give it more weight or fixing it down to a base.

…………………… 
Make it in silicone: tbd, we need something solid, the winning material now is a compound commonly used in the food industry: it's extremely strong, survives the heat of a dishwasher, and it is FDA approved. It's much more expensive than a ""regular"" plastic, but well worth the price for the performance we need.
Make it in stainless: yes, after we reach break-even volumes in plastic. We don't want to get over our heads with separate production lines unless we have sufficient funds to control the process; startups are expensive. We already have a large number of stainless quotes, and we may introduce metals before the end of the campaign.
Cup size: my personal hell, with so many definitions of the cup. Good news: the difference between the “legal” and the “customary” US cup is around 1%, so whatever we choose it shouldn’t make a big difference. For cup definition enthusiasts: there are 20+ of them in use throughout the world; the current bakercube is using the best option to get started.
Larger cubes (I assume starting at 2 cups): sure, after we take care of the regular and the mini version.
Europe: yes, we’ll be shipping there.
Canada: Qui, bien sûr.
MiniCube: After it’s big brother is delivered, we need to take it one step at the time.
Volume Discounts: We'll offer volume discounts and early birds… with the shipping cost of multiple bakercubes close to the cost of shipping of a single bakercube.
Specs: Dishwasher safe, holds liquids, food grade, FDA safe, BPA-free... Yes, that's the plastic we selected, it's commonly used in the food industry.
Emails in the survey: we'll use them exclusively to let you know when the campaign is ready.

Summary
The Pythagorean cup is a drinking vessel designed to drain its contents via siphon action if it is overfilled. If the cup is partially filled, it holds liquid which can be drunk in the usual fashion. If it is overfilled it drains the entire contents of the cup into the drinker's lap. This object was classically used as a warning of the dangers of gluttony and over-consumption.  
Unfortunately, Pythagorean cups feature a distinctive central stem to house the siphon tube which drains the cup - see for instance http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27533. This gives away the surprise and spoils some of the fun! Fortunately, modern 3D printing allows us to build a more devious cup, with a hidden siphon.  
This object is a Pythagorean cup with the siphon tube concealed in the drinking vessel walls. The siphon tube traverses more than 300 degrees of the circumference of the rim, so a moderately filled cup will not drain when it is tilted. This object has been printed and tested, and is 100% functional! It makes a great brainteaser or science demonstration for students.
Instructions
This object was originally printed on a Makerbot Replicator 2:  
Material: Makerbot True Yellow PLA
Layer Thickness: 0.2 mm
Shells: 3
Temp: 240 C
Infill Type: Hex
Infill Density: 20%
Raft: None
Supports: None  
All other settings remained at the Makerware ""standard"" profile default values. The cup should be oriented in a standing fashion for printing.   
For other printers and materials, the chief concern is producing a watertight or nearly watertight surface on the inside of the cup and siphon tube. If you have trouble achieving this, decrease the layer thickness to 0.1mm and bump up the number of shells. If this does not do the trick, tune your extruder for fatter extrusions.   
The STL file produces a ~8 cm tall cup at native scale. The STL mesh is dense enough that it should scale up or down very nicely.  
I have included the original Solidworks file used to produce the STL in case anyone would like to improve this design. If another file format is requested, please leave a comment.

How I Designed This
Summary
This design stores the laundry detergent cup for Tide and Gain brand liquid laundry detergent containers and drains excess leftover soap back into the container.
Single print design (Print in Place)
Fits North American Tide and Gain 4.43L (1.17 US gal/150 fl oz)containers (Proctor and Gamble brands)
Stop wasting laundry detergent by rinsing out the cup or making a mess in your sink.
It is designed for Tide and Gain (Proctor and Gamble) which has a drain opening size of approximately 28mm and the outer thread diameter is 35mm and has a 3mm thread pitch. If you have a different brand, it may work if the dimensions are close to this. The Sunlight brand containers have smaller drain openings so will not fit with this design. 
UPDATE Jan 25, 2018
I've uploaded a .step file as per request.

Notes:
Supports are required to allow the cap to be printed in place. Use fragile supports so they are easy to remove from the small gap between the cap and the part.
Be sure to set your support material minimum overhang settings to 80% or so or else the drainage channel will be filled with support material and the print won't work!
Print flat face down (see last photo)
How I Designed This
Fusion 360
I designed this with Fusion 360. I took photos of the threads and used the attach canvas feature to create the threaded cap. The rest was straight forward. I had some fun coming up with a drainage channel design that would print without creating excessive overhangs. 
The goal was a single print with no post processing other than removing support material for the cap and the very top of the tray.

Let your imagination run wild stacking squares.  With essentially an infinite number of choices in the customizer you can be assured no one will have an object just like your's.  By changing the dimensions you can make planters, trays, bud vases, pencil holders, bracelets, or drinking glasses.  The simpler smaller objects make good demonstration pieces and will print quite quickly.  
Update: Moved max layers from 200 to 800.  Careful with the higher layers it could result in long renders.  Also added a control to force the design to be hollow if you can't do it in your slicer.
Instructions
Run the customizer and choose your parameters and export the STL.  Be careful to avoid large overhangs.  It is quite possible to use the customizer to create something unprintable.  When slicing specify no fill and no top layers.  Once you print it, be sure to upload a photo. I'm curious to see what people end up with. I have several other vase customizers with variations on this theme.  Check out the ""Derived from"" to see the other versions.  
 There is a new control called ""Force Hollow"". This will create a hollow STL for those who can't make the object hollow with their slicer software. Vase produces an STL with only a bottom. Bracelet produces an STL with no top or bottom. The walls are 2mm thick so this may or may not slice nicely depending on your nozzle diameter and layer width. Most should get at least two layers though. It is still best to make the object hollow using your slicing program (instead of the new option) since it will give you best control over the wall thicknesses.

I made this out of frustration with using disposable cardboard sleeves on the new Starbucks $1 reusable cup - plus to add a cooler look to my mug.  
This thing allows you to make your own customized sleeve for a coffee or tea cup! The geometric designs are highly customizable and look great on a plain cup.
Instructions
Use Customizer to design your own sleeve!  
Measure the cup you're using - the design is pre-set for the $1 reusable cups that Starbucks has been selling lately  
Change the variables for the pattern geometry to find a design you like. IMPORTANT: You'll have to play with the variables to avoid a design that has difficult to print overhangs / violations of the 45 degree rule.   
Output from Customizer and print your STL.  Two files will be output - you want to use the one with just the sleeve when you print!

Summary
This is a (still easier to print and assemble) improvement on the previous https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3617536 .  This and that previous submission are both remixes of HappyMoon's ""Floating Cup Sculpture"".
[I've edited the files and summary a bit more (July 7, 2019), as I found that printing the 'stream' part of the sculpture can be difficult on some printers when printed high off the bed.  And that actually, printing it sideways on the bed works and looks much better.
July 19:  rotated the ""preferred"" version of stream so that it can fit also on a 200mmx200mm bed] 
[(May 6, 2020) I've also published a remix of this with different STLs for the stream and splash so that weight can be added to keep it balanced and to improve the glue bond between the stream and the cup.  Get these files at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4342710 ]
I recently was printing one for my daughter, but managed to attach the ""stream"" backwards to the ""splash"", which made it lean the wrong way so it wouldn't stay standing up.  So, this one uses a trapezoid-shaped pin (rather than 2 square pins), which both holds the parts together better and also prevents them being attached backwards.   Other improvements are that the seam between the stream and the splash has been moved lower where it is even less likely to be noticed; and mass has been removed from the part of the ""stream"" that sits inside the cup to improve stability when the sculpture is standing up.
Some tips I've figured out:
1)  Print the ""stream"" part with low infill (10% or even 5%) to minimize the weight of the thick off-center part that is inside the ""cup"".   Be careful removing this part from the bed, since with low infill it won't be as strong -- don't try to pry it off by yanking on the long part of the stream!  The ""stream"" part will need supports, no matter which orientation you choose.
2)  Print the ""cup"" part at low infill (5%) also and low number of perimeters for least weight.  I used PLA and PETG for the cup. You could instead use a styrofoam or paper cup for low weight or for a different look.  Test your glue first if you use those, though, to make sure it will stick to them.
3)  Print the ""splash"" part and the pin with high infill (85% or so, but not quite 100%) to maximize its weight for stability when standing.
4)  Only needed if printing the ""stream"" upright: then use a smaller nozzle when printing, or at least with somewhat small layer heights (about 0.24mm), so the lines don't show too much on the near-horizontal areas.  Some lines may actually add to the liquid appearance, but lines that are too coarse won't look right.
5)  All parts should be printed oriented as the STLs are provided.
There are now three STL files provided for the ""stream"" part, they are exactly the same, but in different orientations for printing.  The one marked ""preferred"" is for printing on its side, and has turned out to be the most trouble-free to print.  In fact, that one is pretty hard to mess up and has a great smooth surface, so it is ""preferred"".  It uses a little more support material than the ""inside down"" version (the one where the large puddle that sits inside the cup lies right on the bed), but gives a very easy to get, smooth surface and is very unlikely to have bed adhesion issues.  The ""inside down"" version uses the least support material, usually prints well, but shows some texture where the support breaks off in the more horizontal puddle area. The ""narrow down"" (don't use that one!) version has a good surface, but uses the most support material and has proven to be more difficult for some people to print since moving beds and gravity can cause it to topple before support material has been completed.  That file is left here for continuity of the file set.
6)  It would seem like a good idea to use ""wood filled"" filament for the coffee/hot chocolate liquid parts -- but don't!  The wood filaments are very brittle and you'll find the thin upper fluid drips of the ""splash"" will break off very easily.  Black or brown PLA would be a better choice, or other colors for other beverages.
7)  I've used super-glue (cyanoacrylate) gel or clear 2-part epoxy glue (best choice) to attach the stream, pin, and splash parts.  Test-fit the pieces first (!), file mating surfaces if necessary.  You may need to trim the edges of the ""pin"" if there is any 'elephant's foot' on the print -- choose the best fitting pin from the set, and use a razor knife, file or sandpaper to trim any squished edges.  THEN, after adding glue and assembling, stand it up on a table near a wall with the part of the stream that will go into the cup pushed slightly against the wall to make it lean a little more toward over the ""splash"" (see photo).   Most important is to prevent it from leaning the other way as gravity would tend to take it!  Leave it set against the wall like that until the glue cures.  As with any time you use epoxy or superglue, avoid moving the glued joint while it cures.
8)  I've used clear epoxy or super-glue gel for attaching cup to the stream, epoxy seems the best.  Hot melt glue might work as well, but be careful as it might also warp the walls of parts.  Put glue only onto the surfaces of the stream that actually contact the inside of the cup to keep weight low there.
9)  The best way I've found to hold the cup and stream together while glue sets is to use a small ratcheting bar clamp or C clamp -- keep the stream down against the cup all the way to its back.
But almost as good is to just lie the cup on its side at the edge of a table and then put the stream&splash inside of it after glue applied, with the splash part hanging under the table. Let gravity do the work.
It might be a good idea to stack up some cards under the back of the cup (not shown in the photo) so that the cup stays tipping forward during curing to help balance.
10)  (yes, there's a duck swimming in the 'with cream' coffee cup.  My daughter likes ducks, what can I say?)  :)
There is a file of trapezoidal pins scaled to a range of sizes, used to attach the ""splash"" to the ""stream"" and keep them aligned.  Choose the largest one that fits into the sockets in the ""stream"" and ""splash"" parts.  Trimming their edges with a knife or clipper, or sanding them down may be required.

This is a remix of the Nuke Lamp from Protonik, which was inspired by:
Original idea for lampshade:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:19478 
I split the lamp in half to cut down on the support needed and added posts for alignment.
OK after printing this beast 4 times, I got something that I like.  I tried translucent and flat white.  The picture and what I ended up liking the most is the translucent ( white blocked most of the light)   I changed the lower section to make it taller. But still have the shorter section file if you want that.  I used 21 leds ( red/orange/yellow)  more red at the top and more orange at the bottom.  The picture looks better than in person. With 10% infill you will see some of the infill lines depending on the angle of viewing. but if you put more infill you will need more leds or be happy with less light coming through.  Don't expect this to light up a room, its more of a nightlight.
I added a different base that fits a square DC adapter. I printed that in white. The original base didn't fit any light fixture that I could find. Not to mention using a plain white light will not get you the coloring that you will like (at least that I liked).

Summary
If you're into target shooting, this is the print for you. This is an adjustable height bench rest for rifle shooting with interchangeable yokes to fit the stock width of your rifle. The height adjustment is done easily by turning the screw and re-tightening the jam-nut. This thing is rock solid once assembled!
There are 3 feet on the bottom to give maximum stability when placed on uneven surfaces. The rifle yoke is positioned appropriately within the tripod for hands-free stability.
All parts of this are 3D printed, even the ½-13 socket heads!
This bench rest is also suitable for holding the rifle secure during maintenance, such as scope mounting, as shown in the video.
If you are looking to improve your shooting accuracy this is the rifle rest you need. Once everyone see's your custom 3D printed bench rest at the range you'll have lots of questions to answer, such as ‘How do I get one of those?’ and ‘Can you make one for me?’
The largest part in this assembly (tripod base) was designed to use the entire print bed of my Ender 3. The bed of your printer must be able to handle a print measuring 8.25"" x 8.25"" [210mm x 210mm] in order to print it (just so you know).
For some printing information, orientation, and other general background information, I recommend watching the video below:
https://youtu.be/baOeFndeQp4

Adjustment Thread - Qty (1) Required
Foot Pad - Qty (3) Required
SHCS - 1_2-13x0.75 - Qty (3) Required
Thread Insert - Qty (1) Required
Threaded LockNut - Qty (1) Required
Tripod Base - Qty (1) Required
Wye for Rifle 150 - Qty (1) Required if stock width is less than 1.5""
Wye for Rifle 175 - Qty (1) Required if stock width is between 1.5"" and 1.75""
Wrap-up:
The model I printed was done from all PLA materials, including the screws. I don't plan on leaving this bench rest in a hot vehicle, but I know it could happen. In the future I plan on printing another one from PETg for longevity.
Using this bench rest definitely improved the accuracy of target shooting my Ruger 10-22. I am interested in hearing what rifles you're using (or intend to use) with it.
I hope you enjoy! Thanks for checking it out! If you like things like this be sure to check out the many other models I have here.
*Update 6-24-24: Models were importing too small, the new models have ""_A"" after them and should come in at the designed size within the slicer, no need to scale up by 2540%.

I found this funny sign on the internet. Since there was no MMU version yet, I simply traced it and prepared it for multi-colour printing. This makes it possible to print the sign from top to bottom so that the prettier front side is on the print bed. 
UPDATE: I added also a version for people without MMU or AMS. So you can manual change the color once at the right high.
The holographic H1H printing plates are particularly recommended.

The MakerBot Headphone Stand went through the same design process used in professional design and engineering industries. Multiple design iterations and 3D prints led to the final fully 3D printable headphone stand. 
The full size stand prints beautifully without any supports and perfectly matches the Replicator+ build volume. 
Designer Jackson Seidenberg uses two of these stands at home for his Logitech G930 and Astro a50 headphones.

Earbud storage case, in two sizes.  The 3.5mm versions have slots for the 3.5mm jack.  (added a large and XL versions, but haven't tried printing them)  
The first 0.4mm works as a hinge, I used clear PET for the first couple of layers since it work better as a hinge material and works as a window, but ABS will work too.  Take a look at the picture with the orange cases to see how it works.

Yet another earbud holder. Not like we have enough of those here on Thingiverse, right? Well, I wanted something a bit different from the designs already available. Specifically I wanted the whole thing to be somewhat enclosed and able to take a beating. I think I've reached those goals.
As a bonus it has a very satisfying clack sound when you close it up ;)
Instructions
UPDATE 2012-12-18: Just a random tip. I've seen that those of you who have been nice enough to post pictures of your prints (Please keep doing that, it makes me happy :) ) are wrapping your cables all the way from bud to plug. What I do is fold the cord in half so that the plug and buds are next to each other. Stuff the buds and plug into the cavity and then wrap up the cord. That will save you time.
UPDATE 2012-12-05: A few people reported issues with the STLs that prevented them from being properly sliced in slic3r. I have uploaded repaired STLs that should work better. Please use the STLs that end with ""_repaired"". I'll keep the old files around for a while just in case these new ones present other issues. Sorry about the troubles this may have caused.
The core can be printed without support without issues. If you have trouble getting it to stick to the bed try printing it upside down, the overhang will be a bit worse but will probably print ok with good cooling.
The shells however needs a bit of support for the nubs, rough/medium support in KISSlicer worked well for me, took under a minute to clean up. Either print individually or use the plate to print both at once.
To assemble simply force the shells over the core until they snap into place. Print the shells fairly solid so that they don't break on assembly. To minimize the risk of breaking do not pull at the protruding tabs, instead grab it like shown in the picture with the green arrow.
This copy was printed on an Ultimaker for those curious.

Rectangular case generator. The inset lid is held in place with friction so using thicker layers can help to keep the case closed (I'm using 200 micron layers).  
The hinge flexes so flexible plastics will work better for this design (I'm using MadeSolid PET+), but less flexible materials may also work (I haven't tried ABS or PLA, but making the hinge longer or thinner may help).

For my new, easier to print version check out this link:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:65810
This is an iPhone 4/4s case with moving gears on the back.  It clips onto my phone perfectly with no wiggle room, and is still pretty easy to take off.
I altered the original rivets to make them easier to print, and scaled the main case a little bit for a better fit.  Other than that, only part orientations have been changed.
The source files can be found at the following links.
http://www.instructables.com/id/IPhone-Cover-for-Engineers/
http://grabcad.com/library/iphone-cover-for-engineers
Instructions
Print the main case, using support.  I believe I used 1.5 mm spaced honeycomb support.  I printed 0.175 mm layers with solid fill to give extra strength.
Print the gears.  The first number in each gear name is the number of teeth, and the final number is how many you need. Use whichever layer height works best for your printer, but I recommend single walls so that there is room for some fill, making the gears stronger.  I printed them with three walls the first time and it left many spaces between the perimeters that were too small to fill.
Print the rivets.  I recommend using single walls, and low layer heights to give extra strength. I would also print slowly with z lift. 
Clean up all of the parts with an sharp knife, and some 220 grit sandpaper.  Test fit all of the gears.  When you're satisfied with the fit push the rivet in place.
After you are completely happy with the case, make sure the rivets are pushed in securely, then flip the case over so you can see the holes for the rivets.  Put a dab of thick CA glue on each rivet to make sure they don't fall out.  Thinner glue may leak through and lock the gears in place.
Wait for the glue to dry, then snap your phone in place and enjoy!
You need to shave a little bit of material away around the silencing slider if you have the iPhone 4s

Summary
Recently we discoverd a really nice technique that makes wood flexible. This is so cool we want to share it with you!
We designed wooden booklets that use this feature. Theyâ€™re made from a beautiful birch plywood and are finished with a clear varnish. The hard wooden cover can be opened fully to the back side for comfortable holding. A tiny clamp inside, made from the same material, holds a standard A7 writing block.
The booklets come in a horizontal and vertical version.
Actually they not only look cool, it shows exactly what we think digital production is all about. By using manufacturing techniques like this it is possible to make all product features in a single production step and in one material. This cuts down production effort and logistics and makes for a beautifully simple product. Because a laser cutter is a fairly common tool products like this could be manufactured locally, all over the world. By working from sheet materials the products can also be flat-packed, saving even more resources and costs on shipping.
For us this means we can make everything in-house and we donâ€™t need to produce in big quantities to make it affordable. This is really the power of digital manufacturing and personal fabrication.

https://www.printables.com/de/social/292428-schultegeiletechnik/about
Original summary
I designed three geometric plant pots for some succulents.
In addition, I created an inside pot for each planter with some holes in their bottom and a little offset from the ground so that excess water can escape.
They were designed to fit small succulents and have an inside width of ~60 to ~65 mm.
They are all around the same hight (roughly 60mm from the ground).
They could be printed bigger and if you do not want to use the second inside pot you could make a hole in the bottom for releasing any excess water.
I would love to see your prints, so if you make one be sure to post a picture under makes.
If you like my designs or have any question leave a comment and maybe consider a little tip. 
Update
I added a stl file for the base. Mine is made of concrete and not 3d printed, but I modeled it anyway to look how the planters would look on it.
It is about 260 mm long so maybe you have to scale it down a little nit to make it fit on your print bed.

Here is a Stone and Wood Fence for table top games.  There are five different stacked stone posts (End, Tru, Tee, Corner, and 4way) to create different fence patterns and three different wood fence versions.  The wide wood fence can also be used to create signs.  
I started playing around with a new style of wood grain.  I think I like it much better, but I would like to know what you think.

I designed a 2 in 1 woodwokring marking gauge.  
It uses an IKEA pencil (the ones you geht for free at the store) or a nail to mark parallel lines to an edge onto a surface.
Its an often used tool at woodworking.
You can also use any other normal pencil with similar size.
You can choose between the nail or the pencil.
The part wich is not needed at that moment can be stored in the rod.
In german, this tool is named Steichmaß.  
You need:  
the 3d-printed parts
2x M3 screws and nuts
1x M5 screw and nut
1x small nail (the hole at the rod has a diameter of 1,3mm but you can drill it bigger if you need to)
1x IKEA pencil

Summary
Script to generate texture via temperature gradients to get horizontal stripes that ""look like wood"".  The last and only updated source code is now on github at https://github.com/MoonCactus/gcode_postprocessors/tree/master/wood
This is the code of my post here: http://betterprinter.blogspot.fr/2012/10/shades-of-brown-with-wood-filament-via.html  
The owl is Cushwa's popular design at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:18218  
The picture which highlights the effect on a regular polygonal vas comes from mttwinmill (https://www.thingiverse.com/make:657526)
This thing is not an object to print, but a set of instruction that will ""patch"" your gcode file in place (it will be modified), so keep a backup if you need one.  
The gcodeFile is the only compulsory parameter.  Check the source code for more information.
Initial temperature settings will be overridden by the varying pattern that is generated by this script (a variant of recursive Perlin noise). You can run it multiple times to test different values and generated temperature curve until you like it.  
Default values are minTemp=190, maxTemp=230 and grainSize=3.  Higher temperatures produce darker bands (due to the wood being burnt). Do not let the wood stay too long in your nozzle else you might end up clogging it with carbon (which is quite hard to clean up)!
Download the latest python script from https://github.com/MoonCactus/gcode_postprocessors/tree/master/wood
This script was designed and works with ""Python"" (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
How to run it on windows (thanks to Nic/@nd1985):
Install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ or check http://docs.python.org/2/faq/windows.html
Open the windows command prompt.
If you search for cmd, it will pop up.
Drag the python file into the command prompt
Type -f and drag in the gcode file you want to modify
Type -i and enter the minimum temp you want (e.g. -i 180, with a space between the option and the Celcius degree)
idem, use -a maxtemp if you want
also -g grainsize if you want. I used the default 3.0
Hit enter. The script will process. When finished, the command prompt will reset to the state it was in when you first started. The original gcode you entered has now been modified.
Basic parameters
-f aka --file <pathToFile.gcode> G-code file to process (with complete path if needed). This is the only required parameter.
-i aka --min <celciusDegrees> Minimum allowed temperature (too low and the filament will not extrude!). Default is 180
-a aka --max <celciusDegrees> Maximum allowed temperature (too high and the filament will carbonize!). Default is 230
Aesthetics
-g aka --grain <millimeters> Average ""width"" of the patterns (smaller means faster variations). Default is 3.0
-z aka --z-offset <millimeters> Shift the pattern vertically (e.g. if you want it to match some geometrical feature of your design). Default is 0.0
-r aka --random-seed <integer> Use a completely different pattern
-s aka --spikiness-power <float> How ""spiky"" are the dark bands (sets the imbalance of light/dark bands). With higher values (eg 2 or 3), the dark stripes will be made sparser. You can get the opposite effect with value between 0 and 1 (eg. 0.5 will generate fatter dark bands, convenient for filament that get lighter with temperature). Values below 0.2 or above 3.0 are probably useless.
Advanced options
These are mostly to play nice with a few printer firmwares. Use only when needed!
-k aka --skip-start-z <millimeters> Do not change temperatures until provided height (e.g. when you are using a support/raft)
-t aka --first-temp <celciusDegrees> Which temperature to start with. Default is to set it.
-u aka --max-upward <celciusDegrees> Cap instant temperatures increases (in °C/layer), default is no cap!
-d aka --max-downward <celciusDegrees> Cap instant temperatures decreases (in °C/layer)
-c aka --scan-for-z-hop <millimeters> Try to detect the ""Z-hop"" that some slicer do. Default is 5mm, use 0 to disable it.
-w aka --temp-command <string> set the temperature g-code command to use (defaut is M104, but you might want M109 that waits for the temperature to settle before moving on, some printers may need this)
If you are using a command line interpreter and you have Python installed on your machine, you can run it like this, e.g. to generate temperatures that vary within 205 and 235°C use the following:
python wood.py --min 205 --max 235 --file myfile.gcode
When you want ""faster"" variations, just change the default 3mm --grain and use a smaller value, like
python wood.py --min 205 --max 235 --grain 1.5 --file myfile.gcode
If your printer stops with a ""thermal runaway"" error, you can tell the script to go slower and wait for temperatures to settle on each change, by using an alternate g-code command, e.g.:
python wood.py -w M109 --file myfile.gcode
(see https://www.simplify3d.com/support/articles/3d-printing-gcode-tutorial/#M104-M109 about the issue)
 About Cura and Cura plugins 
After multiple requests and at last, I converted the initial Cura plugin to a standalone Python script that no more needs Cura nor Skeinforge. I documented the process here by the way: http://betterprinter.blogspot.fr/2013/02/how-tun-run-python-cura-plugin-without.html  
This script was an early but official plugin in Cura (version 12.11+). But Ultimaker broke its own support to the plugins with almost each new release (why?). I hope forthcoming Cura 4 will eventually settle to something that would not require me to fix the script with each new release. Sorry, but there will be no more support for Cura until they make their mind!

My first bathtub boat
so that young and old captains can play in their own bathtub
In the file the ship is 10cm (3.93in) long. But my prints are only 8,5cm (3.34in) long.
So I printed the ship about 13 percent smaller.
thanks to Adafruit Industries for the great video
Even if my boats are not benchmarks (benchy), you can use them for quality control.

Although it is a lot of fun to draw boats and bring them to life, it takes a lot of time to research and draw. Especially the 1:1000 scale models are very time-consuming.So I wanted to see if there are any dear enthusiasts among you who appreciate my work and support me a little bit. Thank you for your help :)

How I Designed This
Summary
I was recently in the Portland Japanese Garden where I saw a pleasant Shishi Odoshi fountain. It fills with water until it tips over and dumps the water out, making a noise that's meant to scare away deer that might otherwise eat your meticulously manicured garden. I was inspired to try to create a miniaturized, indoor-scale version, complete with pump and reservoir so it really works - right on your desk!
The basic theory of operation is simple: the main tube is weighted below the hinge and hollow above the hinge. Though the top is longer than the bottom, it still weighs less than the bottom when it's empty, so the tube sits upright. As the top of the tube fills with water, it eventually weighs more than the bottom, upsetting the balance and tipping over. The water spills out, the tube rights itself and the cycle begins again.
My design has a reservoir below the tube that holds about a cup (1/4 liter) of water and a small pump that cycles the water back up to the tube.
Here's a video of the fountain operating!

See notes
Notes:
The main tube must be printed nearly solid (e.g. 70% infill). This is required because the bottom of the tube acts as a counterweight. If you print it with hollow or sparse infill, it may not work.
The remainder of the parts can be printed at a standard infill such as 20%.

Parts Needed
You need 5 additional parts to assemble the fountain. They're all available from Amazon Prime.

A DC power supply in the range of about 3.3v to 5v DC. You might have an old cell phone charger or something around; if not, here's a cheap switching power supply with 3.3v output: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OZDY950
Assembly
Place the pump's mounting bracket over the pump.
Spread silicone sealant around the outside of the pump's inlet port - i.e., the part of the pump that will go through the hole in the side of the water reservoir. Putting the sealant on the port before putting the port into the reservoir makes for a better seal because it's hard to access all the little crevices after the pump is in place.
Push the pump into the reservoir. It'll take some force; I made it a tight fit on purpose to try and reduce leakage.
Place the M3x12mm screws through the outside of the base and through the pump mounting bracket. Tighten with M3 nuts. Ensure that there are M3 washers between the screw head and the plastic base, and between the nut and the pump bracket, as pictured.
Place more sealant around the pump's inlet port on the inside of the reservoir to keep water from leaking out the hole.
Cut a length of vinyl tubing to about 10 inches (25 cm). Push one end of the tube about 1.5 inches (3.5cm) inside the inlet hole so it's secure. (The inlet hole is on the same side of the base as the pump is mounted; see photos.).
Spread sealant around where the vinyl tube enters the inlet hole.
Place the square water riser tube in the top of the base (see photos) and spread sealant around the bottom of the riser where it enters the base.
Wait for the sealant to cure. The sealant's instructions will tell you how long to wait, probably between 24 and 72 hours.
Attach the other end of the vinyl water tube to the barbed outlet port on the pump.
Place the two support struts in the side hinge holes of the big tube and place the struts in the base.
Cut the end of the power adapter off and strip the wires and attach them to the pump. The pump's blue wire is positive and should be attached to the red wire of your power supply. The pump's brown is negative and should be attached to the black wire of your power supply.
Fill the reservoir with water and plug in the pump!

Summary
I made a water droplet desk toy. When you crank the handle on the side, the top moves in a wave-like pattern, imitating a droplet landing in water. I was inspired by this. Here is a gif of it moving from the side and here's one from the top.
Update 9/27/17 5:00 PM: Fixed center droplet to be scaled properly to the rest of the model.
Update 9/22/17 11:30 AM: Added STEP file containing all pieces for easier modifications.
Update 9/19/17 2:15 PM: Added ""Top Strip"" and ""Middle Strip."" This will allow for a quicker print time and a different overall style.

Notes:
Print one of each of these: base, cap, center, handle, middle or middle strip, rings, shaft, spacer, and top or top strip.
The only piece you absolutely need support for is the shaft. Everything else is up to your discretion but really isn't necessary. For the center droplet, you can print it either on its side or vertically, but I recommend on its side with support on to decrease the chance that it would fall over during printing. On some printers, the gap between the moving rings and the base plates may be too tight, in that case try making the rings at 98-99% size, or you could just use a file on the edges of the holes in the base plates.
Post-Printing
Start by placing the shaft in the holes of the base. You should be able to slightly flex the base to squeeze it in there. Next You can put the middle base plate, then the top base plate. Now you can add the rings through the base plates. If they aren't free-moving try to file the holes to be a little bit wider. Finally use a little super glue and place the cap on one end of the shaft and the spacer and handle on the other side of the shaft, making sure that the rings and the shaft are aligned properly.

I keep my dog hydrated with this bottle carrier that doubles as a bowl.   
I designed it specifically to work with 16.9oz Poland Spring bottles - one of the more ubiquitous water bottles around in my neck of the woods.   
The paw prints keep it from rolling around when set down, but I usually hold it in my hand while using it. I included a version without the paw prints as well as a little matching cap so that people know it's the dog's bottle.   
Stay hydrated! 
Instructions
You can run a string (I used a shoelace) through the two holes as a shoulder strap which also helps keep the bottle in tightly.   
The build took 2:40 on a Replicator2 with supports and .30mm layers.  
Since the build uses supports, the bottom side could do with a bit of sanding.

UPDATE: Version 2 of the drinkpond has been out in the wild for quite a while now and I haven't received any complaints whatsoever. If you want to have a drinkpond, you should chose version 2 over version 1.
UPDATE: Version 2 of the drinkpond available now with 5mm higher water level and a cutout to reduce amount of plastic needed and hopefully reduce ABS warping. ATM untested, print at own risk.  
This is a cat drinking pond that takes soda bottles (like coke, pepsi, etc) with a pco028 thread as a reservoir. The water level is kept constant without the need for permanent monitoring on your side.  
All corners and edges are nicely rounded so your tippy-toe doesn't hurt itself - also it looks much better.  
L*** the cat: ""Yay, I can haz water purr*""  
Got inspired by the ""pond for small animals"", my thing is a complete redesign though.

Instructions
Print the cat-drinkpond-v2.stl file:  
Please make sure to use a ""food safe"" plastic to not put your pet's health at risk. Extruding the plastic through a brass nozzle might increase the lead content of final product. (Also see the discussion below)

Then go and find some empty PET-bottle (no pun intended) that has a PCO028 thread (coke bottle, or similar thick-walled bottle). Fill the bottle with water and screw it into the socket of the pond. I would suggest the small .5l or the 1l size at max. any bigger than that and the pond will probably tip over quite easily.  
I designed this thing to be massive and survive everyday use: before you print, double check the gcode so you don't waste plastic on a useless non-watertight print.  
If you already have a bowl that you like to use with a bottle as a reservoir you can also print the cat-drinkpond-tower.stl, which basically is a stand for the bottle with some openings. You'd have to tether the bottle somehow to avoid that your cat tips it over, though.

Summary
Introducing the first design from Parallel Goods.  
This Self-Watering Planter is exactly the growing environment your plants need, while giving you flexibility in your watering routine. It’s super easy to use:  just plant your favorite herb or other water-intensive plant, add water, and you’re all set.  
The Self-Watering Planter was designed to be 3D printed, easy to setup, use and clean; while at the same time allow for customization through mixing and matching different colors for the pot and reservoir. Be sure to check out the Instructions tab to make sure you get the most out this Self-Watering Planter.  
This Self-Watering Planter is part of our 2015 Desk Collection, with more great designs available at parallelgoods.co.   
Follow us on Thingiverse, join our Thingiverse Group, and follow us on Twitter and Instagram @parallelgoods and stay tuned!
This Self-Watering Planter was design to be printed in PLA, and we went through many iterations and lots of experimentation to develop settings which would allow for a water tight print. All of our testing and development was done in PLA to ensure success across a wide variety of printers, without causing too much of an impact to the environment.
Water Tight PLA Slic3r Settings
Layer Height: .3mm
Vertical Shells (Perimeters): 3
Horizontal Shells (Solid Layers): Top - 4, Bottom - 4
Infill: 100%
Speed: Top Solid Infill - 15mm/s, Solid infill - 15mm/s
Prints WITHOUT Supports
The extra top & bottom shells combined with the slow solid infill print speeds ensure a thick and even wall for the bottom of the reservoir which provides water tight print. Your mileage may vary, but these settings should give you a fine starting point for use on your own printer.
Post-Printing
If you're unable to get a water tight print...
If you're unable to get a water tight print, we recommend coating the bottom of the reservoir in Titebond Ultimate Wood Glue. This particular wood glue is waterproof, but still non-toxic, solvent free, and is FDA approved for indirect food contact (i.e. cutting boards).  
Using your Self-Watering Planter
Set the pot in the reservoir, add your plant of choice, and fill the reservoir to the line inside of the spout. Refill whenever you can’t see any water in the spout. Every few refill cycles it’s helpful to let the soil dry out to prevent mold from growing inside the pot.

This is a functional micro centrifugal water pump that has been tested and works. It is not self priming but certainly can put water well once it gets going. The design is exceptionally compact only taking up about 2""x1""x1"". This is designed to be used with 5/16 vinyl tubing and a compact motor to drive the pump. I will include amazon links to the specific parts that it was designed for.

Think you are up to printing this bad boy?
Pics or it didn't happen!
Hudson came by to say, ""Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen! This is a LIFE-SIZE ALIEN FACEHUGGER, coming in at 40in x 23in!
It's big.
It's bad.
It wants to attach to your neck and clutch your civi face.
No hollering game over man, game over until you finish that print job soldier! You will need nukes, knives, and sharp sticks to fend this sucker off. Now go warm that hotbed on the double!""
-That said, about 90% of the original Mini-Face Hugger model has been completely remodeled  with:
1) All new joints that are much tighter
2) All pieces are no longer flat but are now fully formed skeletal structures with tendons.
3) The ""face"" bottom part was modeled.
5) Completely new tail from the ground up!
6) Plating and other effects to skeletal structure added. 
I taught myself blender and spent about 3 weeks modeling this and printing the pieces over and over again until I got them just right. That said, it's NOT absolutely perfect, but it did scare the bajeezus out of our cat. I twitched it at her while she was sniffing it and she did a backward somersault, (It was immensely satisfying), so that is saying something about how it turned out.
Update (12/2019)
I want to send a huge ""thank you"" to all of you that finished the project and shared your pictures. I thoroughly enjoy the pictures you post with our faceHugger friend attacking you, your children, your dog, especially your cats, computers, and oddly frequent, your 3D printer. I'm not sure why Facehuggers attack 3D printers, but it appears they have an affinity to that particular form of non-living matter. Anyway, it is has made all the time and effort spent modeling/printing it totally worth it. Have a great new year, and happy printing! 
EXTRA BONUS! I have replaced the body STLs with the Netfabb repaired images, courtesy of rodrifra. The download should now solve the mesh issues a few people have run into. Thanks rodrifra!
.
========[ HOW TO PUT IT TOGETHER ]=========
You will need an adhesive!
If using PLA: Super Glue and sand paper!
If using ABS: Superglue will work, but I STRONGLY recommend making an ABS slurry (Dissolve ABS scraps in a pickle jar with acetone poured in until it's gooey/soupy...just be very careful of the vapors. They are both explosive AND dangerous!) 
*For certain printers, you may need to turn on ""Unstick Protection Geometry""! 
A) You should print the body with as little infill as you can get away with (like 15%-20% if possible). The lighter it is, the easier it will stand up on its own! 
B) I used 0.15mm per layer with 4 count perimeter. This is important because the outer layer of the joints need to be THICK and STURDY. This keeps them from splitting when putting the ball joints together which can require quite a bit of pressure. 
C) Print it a bit hotter than usual to get a really good bond between layers. 
D) I used WHITE PLA, but I think ABS will do a lot better because it has a little flex to it. That is very good for the joints because PLA is pretty stiff stuff and not to forgiving. You may be best served printing the body in PLA, and the legs/tail in ABS unless you put mouse-ears on the body. 
E) Sand down the flat parts of the joints with rough sand paper to make them scratched up before using the super glue to get a really strong bond. If you are using ABS, I STRONGLY recommend making ABS slurry glue (ABS leftovers + Acetone in a pickle jar...mix until a medium-thick syrup). It will FUSE the components and you won't ever have a split happen. It's much stronger than super glue with PLA.
F) When printing the Tail grouping files, the order of the tail pieces is left to right, top to bottom. I provided a STL with two legs you can print at once if you have a large enough bed. If not, use the OneLeg_PLA.stl 
G) In the first Tail Grouping, the big part that attaches to the body should be glued so it does not bend. It was not meant to be tight since it's still technically a non-flexible part of the body. But, you may decide to leave it bendable. That is up to you!.
H) In case just a part of your leg print fails (which sometimes happens with multiple pieces in a print), I've supplied the individual leg piece STLs.
I) LAST BUT NOT LEAST! If the joints are WAY too tight, you are probably suffering from over-extrusion. Back off the extrusion a bit until they fit right. The joints are supposed to be tight so that you can pose it, (especially on one of the cool stands our friends shared at the top of this description), but if you do over-extrude, they will not fit together right no matter how hard you try to snap them together.
Enjoy!

Alien Life Chess Set
This is an ""Alien Life"" chess set. Inspired by the Black Marker in Dead Space (and 3d prints of it, found on Thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1538807) this is an original chess set, designed by myself and modeled in blender. I haven't had too much experience in printing 3d models (except for another chess set I made a long while back), so any feedback or comments would be much appreciated!
Thank you so much @tselling for the most excellent pictures of the pieces lined up!
And thanks to Access3Dservices for the awesome pictures of the pieces on the print bed (black and white - full set)! Checkout their Instagram for more awesome stuff!
Thanks guys for the awesome feedback! If you have some pictures of the set I'd love to see it!
Update Log
UPDATE: MAY 22nd 2016: I have re-uploaded all the files in proper mm units (with the king being 37.25 x 37.25 x 80.75 mm or 1.46 x 1.46 x 3.18 in). I have also included a full set including 8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops, 2 Knights, a King, and of course a Queen.
UPDATE: JUNE 16th 2016: I have re-uploaded (again) all the files. Thanks to the help of cymon, whose helped me make the set more print ready! Also, have run it through Microsoft / Netfabb's 3d model fixer - https://netfabb.azurewebsites.net/, but if there are any issues please mention it. Again THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS... so I will occasionally make changes. These changes make the set more print friendly (especially for FFF printers), or for aesthetic reasons. While the Pawn and Rook are mostly unchanged, the bishop should be slightly more FFF friendly, the Knight looks more like a classic Knight piece, King has thicker limbs as does the Queen for easier printing.
UPDATE: JUNE 20th 2016: Uploaded new versions of King and Knight (and updated FullSet and PieceSet for those respective changes). I can say that I'm now really pleased how all the pieces came out- sorry for making so many changes. This will be my last change for a while (unless there is a glaring issue that needs resolving). Any feedback is welcomed, design or otherwise. Thanks!
UPDATE: AUGUST 19th 2016, the knights aren't flat on the ground with the rest of the pieces!! Oh no! It is fixed now tho. Thanks for pointing it out 1sPiRe

This is an alien cube I recently designed. Kind of has a Tron feel to it. Could be used as a movie prop.
There are thin lines that allows light to dimly pass through and larger lines that are all the way cut out to let the light easily pass through.
It comes it 6 panels that can be glued together.   
making of:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-dZ0eYe0wc
Thank you for your support!
Instructions
Print all 6 panels.
Glue together like the order I show in the pics. Or any order you like. But don't glue the top panel so you can turn on and off the light.
And I used a transparent folder i found at Office Depot.
And a light i found at Harbor Freight but any similar light and transparent material would work just fine.
And finally some silver metallic spay paint will really make this look cool.

I made this for a friend, but was not able to print this thing. My printer is not good enough or to small, or both, I don't know but every trial ended in a mess.  
But maybe you like to try your luck??!  :o)  
This Alien figure is based on a free fan art model you can easily find online.
I used XNLara to do the pose and some other tools to make it printable.

How I Designed This
Summary
Aliens!
Started with a rough shape from an Onshape document I made. Then made it much, much more interesting using MeshMixer.
10-31-16 Update: added a larger version (180mm tall), smoother one with a hanger slot on the back.
11-1-16 Update: added a smaller version (50mm tall) with hole on back for 12mmx3mm magnet. Also added eyebrow horns and widen the head a bit.

Notes:
Printed in old ABS. My print room was a bit cool and no enclosure yet, so my ABS split in a few places. But planned on finishing it with acetone so wasn't a loss.
Printed without supports on the back of the head. Took about 6.5 hours on my printer. YMMV.
Post-Printing
Brushed on acetone (only works for ABS and ASA) and then packed the cracks with filament. Then liberally applied more acetone with lots brush strokes removing excess. Let dry a bit and add more.
How I Designed This
Started with a  very loose shape I made in Onshape then expected it as an STL into MeshMixer. Then worked it until it was alien enough for me.

This is an alien skull from the Syfy Original Series, Hunters.
A cross between gritty crime drama and sci-fi thriller, Hunters comes from executive producers Gale Anne Hurd (The Walking Dead, The Terminator trilogy) and Natalie Chaidez (12 Monkeys, Heroes). It is inspired by Whitley Strieber’s best-selling novel, Alien Hunter. The show is about the disappearance of a decorated FBI agent's wife, which leads him to a secret government unit assembled to hunt a group of ruthless terrorists called ""Hunters"" who do not come from this world.

I designed this clip to clip my sunglasses to my cars sun visor when not in use. It works very well for my sunglasses.
Update:
For places that get hotter PLA will likely melt a bit and cause the model to bend. Comments typically recommend Nylon or ABS (thank you, everybody). I also posted a new version not necessarily to replace this but its a different design that should be better at holding the sunglasses and not warping quite as much.

Summary
The Car Headrest Bag Hooks design is similar to some commercially available... but unlike other designs this is made in a way that this cannot be accidentally detached / unhooked from the heat rest posts due to the way it assembles. 
Headrest Bag Hooks are a great solution for your own use but will also be appreciated by many people as a practical gift for everyday use. And, they look great printed in any color or even multiple colors. 
Before starting you will need to measure your cars headrest seat posts to decide which Bracket and Spacer to download and print. Most cars will use the (up to) 15mm seat post version but an 18mm alternative set is provided.   
Assembly and fitting is easy, as follows:
(1) Raise the headrest in your car so the U shaped Bracket can be pushed onto one of your headrest posts
(2) Insert the Spacer to close off the open end of the Bracket
(3) Slide the Centre section through the Bracket and Spacer until it is centred (protrudes out of the Bracket equally on each side). You will need to align the flat surface of the Centre section with the flat surfaces inside the holes in the Bracket.
(4) Slide two Hooks onto the assemble (one on each side)
(5) Screw one Bolt into each end of the Centre section and tighten.
(6) Make sure the hooks can still swing freely and individually on the Centre section.
(7) Lowering the headrest is suggested as this will reduce how much the assembly can move around in use.
(8) Place one or two bags onto the Hooks as required...
For a great result that assembles easily, functions well and is strong / durable files need to be precisely sliced and the parts printed on an accurate well set up machine. This should be easy to print, fit / assemble and ready for use within minutes of the last part being completed.
Please refer to the images and instructions for additional information including fitting and assembly. And, please also post images of your Headrest Bag Hooks in use for other members to see. 
Note: If you like this check out the rest of my practical and fun designs. 
Tips: Tips are not expected but are appreciated as they help offset my filament costs as much as anything else. However, as I live outside the USA tips cannot be sent to me via PayPal.Me as that service is not supported in my region and this is beyond Thingverse's control. If you feel like sending a tip please use regular PayPal and send it to muzz64nz@gmail.com and, to those who do,  thanks in advance!

Since I didn't happen to have any toy wheels just laying around, I designed some to be printed.
Changes from original:
-Added sweet rimzzz
-Exhaust port changed to round hole, increased size to 7mm diameter.
-Wheel mount holes changed to fit small finishing nails
-Added lip to balloon stem
Instructions
Extra Hardware needed:
4 Small finishing nails (3d 1-1/4"")
4 m3 washer or similar tiny size
Print car and wheels.  Use low infill for MAXIMUM POWER-TO-WEIGHT RATIO!
Test fit each wheel on a nail to make sure they spin freely.  I had to use a fine round needle file to clean the holes a bit.
Put small m3 washer on nail/axle between wheels and car body.  This might not be necessary, but I had some washers and thought it was a good idea.
Tap nails into guide holes.
Put a balloon on and have a blast!
I've only printed one of these so far and the nail holes were originally way too small.  It was bending the nails trying to hammer them in!  I had to drill out the holes a tiny bit for a good fit.  I changed the script to make slightly larger holes, so hopefully this will work for other people without the need to drill.

This car model is loosely based on a mercedes C9 le man car.
The model was split in half as it prints better this way. Unfortunately on my set up it warped quite badly and so it could do with some tweaking. 
The model is pictured in two halves but can be glued together on an unwarped print.
I've uploaded a step. file for anyone who would like to edit the model.
UPDATE1- I've added two more files, an stl and stp of 'car thingi whole'. This is the same model which will probably require support material but you won't need to glue the two halves together. Thanks for the suggestion jfpion.
Please upload a photo if you print one :)
Instructions
The example pictured was printed at 0.2mm on a rep2 with a 25% infill which is definitely overkill. I also halved the default extruder speed in makerware in the hope of improving surface finish. It took about 4 hours to print. The arctic white plastic is from faberdashery,  definitely recommended despite the price.
I would also suggest enlarging the stl file before printing, as you can see on my print the wheel arch was too thin so it hasn't been filled in properly.
The wheels were super glued in place but I'm sure someone could modify the car to allow for rotating wheels. The aim was to glue the two body halves together, which should be straight forward as long as your model doesn't warp!
I positioned a number of ear rafts around the car from whpthomas http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:38272. The aim was to reduce warping although the blue tape I was printing on started to lift off the build plate, I think printing PLA straight onto the build plate would be fine or just using stronger wider tape.

This antique car is not a specific model, but a stereotypical car from the late 1950s.  I started with the general shape of the car, then added some features, such as the lights, bumper and windows.
I have always enjoyed making model cars and airplanes, so I made this as a small addition.  My interest in old car models is a Ford Thunderbird that my grandfather owns.  Although not operational, I hope that it will be rebuilt someday.     
Instructions
Upload the stl. file onto the makerbot.  I found that standing the car on its side is best, scince all the features on that side turned out alright.  The only trouble could be the wheels on the side not flush with the board.  Although they stayed attached for my car, they could be messed up.  If so, just cut off the defective wheels and make replacements, which are pretty simple.

A tiny toy dump truck, no assembly required. 
Captive wheels and dump box.
Inspired by toy tanker truck by jag http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5273
The picture shows the series of intermediate designs.
Instructions
The wheels will most likely need to be broken free (just grab both sides of a single axis and twist) and some manual cleanup around the axle holding the dump box to the body will most likely be necessary.
Print was sliced with Skeinforge:
Layer Thickness: 0.2mm
Perimeter Width over Thickness (ratio): 2.5
2011-07-05 The new -V2.scad file fixes a bug that occurs if you attempt to change the wheel_dia or body_lift variables. Otherwise, the design is unchanged.
2011-12-14 Added version 3 (V3) files. This version shortens the bed axle a bit and adds a cap to the bed axle sleeve. This constrains the bed so that it cannot slip so far out of alignment with the truck body when the bed is raised.
2012-01-03 Repaired all files so that they are manifold (according to the netfabb cloud service).

With a well set up 3D printer this will print the very fine thread (0.75mm pitch) so you can screw them straight on in place of existing valve caps. This is a fantastic example of the fine detail that can be printed as the thread is clearly visible (refer images).   
Refer to the instructions for printing details... this must be printed at high resolution (0.1mm) to create a clean thread.  
The file includes a MakerBot M logo so MakerBot owners in particular will appreciate this print that demonstrates the accuracy that can be achieved by looking at the thread.   
If you like this take time to check out my other designs!  
Instructions
Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure you get a good clean thread as it is 'very' fine but works great when printed on a well set up machine capable of accurate prints.   
On a Replicator 2 this prints well as follows...  
Raft: On
Resolution: 0.1mm / High
Support: Off
Shells: 4
Infill: 50% (...or more)   
If you want to change the colour of the MakerBot M as in the images Z-pause the machine at 13.0mm through the print (on a Replicator 2 with Raft on... as that is approx. 1.0mm thick)) and change colors. On machines without a Z-pause feature you will need to pause it / change filament as soon as you see the M logo starting to print.

Cool RepRap Action Car designed by Patrick Prosic
Instructions
The zip file includes STL files for the Cassis and the front and back wheels.
The cassis has a slightly bent base which is bad if you want to print it with a reprap. So I included another version that has a flat base and holes for the axis for the wheels - ActionCar_FlatBase.stl - if you want to print this then take this file.

this is my first attempt at a 3D printable object. It's based on a design (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9710#) I saw at my friend's house. It is a single print that has moving parts. This has now been updated to have much better tolerances between the wheel and the wheel-well. Enjoy :D
Instructions
Note: I've uploaded a new file that should fix the issue that slic3r was having (resulting in only half the car printing) also, smoothed for better wheel rotation. VRRROOOM!
I printed this to be about 4 inches long on the longest side, at that scale the tolerance around the wheels work great! You could probably print it smaller (as long as your printer is well calibrated) or bigger and it would be fine.

This is a tool to cut small diameter rods or tubes using a Dremel. I use it with a Dremel 395. It has the Dremel thread (M18x2,25/ANSI 3/4-12) in the guide part, so you can just easily screw the Dremel in. You will need a small tube or rod with a 10mm diameter to connect the two parts. The guide part might need some sanding to fit in the base, I wanted it to fit nicely with little play.
I also made a non-metric version for the hinge. You can use a 3/8"" axle for the hinge instead of the 10mm axle. The files with ""_38"" in the filename are the 3/8"" axle version. I hope the tolerances are okay to fit the axle in.
Also added a support-block, for supporting the loose end of the tube/rod to be cut.
EDIT 2019/01/26
I added the .step files for the 3/8"" hinge version, so everyone is free to make their own mods.
EDIT 2019/02/04
Modified the base part, so the flex guide part would not collide anymore with the base. Since I don't have the flexible extension for the Dremel, I cannot test the flex guide part.
If you are using the regular guide or guide_38 part you are fine, nothing to change.

Fishing rod holder. Holds up to four rods. Counter sunk holes are sized for a standard drywall screw. Hole opening is 4mm, countersink opens up to 8.8mm.
You need one base where the rod bases sit and one clip. I have a large and small version of each. 
The large version has a depth of 64-70mm. Print this for med-heavy rods.
The small version has a depth of about 40mm so the rods hold tighter to the wall. This works great for light - ultra light tackle.
One version of the base has a small fish imprinted on the front of it. I posted a second version without the fish in case you prefer not to have it. 
Images have been added showing the two sizes side by side for comparison.

I am using 32mm /1.25inch tubes to hold my filament spools. I got some spools with 53mm/2inch inner diameter. With this hub adapter they fit perfect.   
There are some filament spool hub adapters but I can't find one to simply plug into the filament spool having the right size.  
So I made this Universal Spool Hub Adapter for the Customizer. You can not only change the dimensions, you can also define or remove the collar or chamfer if you want. There is automaticly a 1mm backlash added to the inner diameter to make it easy rotating on the axle/tube (Advanced Settings). On the outer diameter is also an extra mm added to fit it tight on the spool (I called it ""Arm Compression"" in the Customizer).  
I have uploaded the 25mm version for the original Prusa i3 HEPHESTOS holder. Many thanks to Runkel for making and testing it. After seeing fcartegnie clever parametrized remix I have added three new versions of the 25mm adapter with only 4 arms.   
There seems to be a rendering problem inside the Customizer, I can't find the reason. But the resulting STL files are perfect.  
Here are my other printer parts you may also interested:

These stabilizers will fix the loose rods in the Z-Axis of the Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer. This is part of an ongoing project to upgrade the Mini on a budget!
Print these brackets with the flat side down, then install them on your rods under the factory brackets. Make sure the raised grips for the rods are facing towards the underside of the brackets (away from the printer sheet metal). 
For detailed instructions, follow along as we tweak and mod our Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer with cheap upgrades to make it into a precision 3D Printing Instrument, on our Hack-a-Day Project page here: https://hackaday.io/project/14823-maximum-3d-printer-bang-for-the-buck

My Anet A6/A8 Upgrades
Summary
IMPORTANT: Get the latest updates for this model here on PrusaPrinters.
In 2021, all updates and uploads of new models were moved to PrusaPrinters, of course still free and under the same conditions... :)
If you want better prints and faster printing, you need to make the Anet A6/A8 more regid with a stiffer frame.
One way of doing this, is to clamp/mount the y-carriage M8 rods to a solid base plate. The plate can be plywood or similar.
Most other solutions I found is either too big, requires dis-assembly or lacks a firm grip on the frame.
This design is a simple U shaped clamp/mount with integrated thread, keeping a firm solid grip, no sliding when printing.
Very easy to use after the printer is assembled - Place printer on base, put clamps on M8 rods, mark holes and fix printer to base with screws.
To assemble you will need:
4x printed base frame clamps (optional without thread).
8x Screws for mounting clamps to base plate.
I have provided a version without threading if needed.
See photos for assembly. Steady printing ... :-)

Notes:
Supports only needed for Mewtwo King piece. Use tree supports for best results. A few supports have been built into the STL file which can be easily removed and reduce total supports generated by slicer. Recommend leaving supports on tail, arms and leg intact for added stability.
How I Designed This
The entire design was done through the Tinkercad online 3D design program, and comprised of multiple files pulled off of Thingiverse. 
In order to create the prints, I downloaded the design for pre-made 3D chess pieces. The chess pieces were then adjusted so that each piece would have a flat top to act as the base for the Pokemon. Each piece was also scaled down so that even after placing the Pokemon on top, they would still be near regulation sizes. 
Individual Pokemon designs were then downloaded and placed at the top of the pieces after being scaled down. Minor changes were then made, such as putting a notch in Bulbasaur's bulb, or placing a sword in Charmander's hands. Pokeball Pawns were made by simply taking a regular chess pawn and editing to sphere on top to resemble a Pokeball. 
Instructions
Quantity and color of each piece
Mew King - ------------Black (0) - White (1)
Mewtwo King --------- Black (1) - White (0)
Pikachu Queen ------ Black (1) - White (1)
Bulbasaur Bishop --- Black (2) - White (2)
Charmander Knight - Black (2) - White (2)
Squirtle Rook - --------Black (2) - White (2)
Pokeball Pawn ------- Black (8) - White (8)
Mewtwo King should be printed with better resolution due to smaller details of design
I have found that other pieces commonly misprint at higher resolutions, and so are better printed with a 0.4 nozzle

Summary
Replace regular board game pawns with PokéPawns in a wide variety of games!
Tired of the thimble and wheelbarrow in Monopoly? Use Squirtle and Bulbasaur instead. Don't like the cut of Colonel Mustard's jib? Let Pikachu wander through the mansion in his place. Fancy a change of pace in Betrayal at House on the Hill? Subject a squad of Pokemon to the inevitable haunting instead of the regular crew.
These pawns are close to the size of regular pawns, so they should work well in a variety of games. Dimensions in the .stl files are in millimeters.
Printable with a single-extruder printer. Superglue required.
The pawns can be locked into place in the box. The base of the pawns are slightly elliptical, and so are the holes in the box; insert the piece into the hole and give it a small twist. This will tighten the piece into place.
Thanks to the designers who made these fantastic low-poly models.
Instructions
Before printing all the pieces, print base-lock-test to make sure the piece-locking mechanism will work with your printer settings, and to figure out how big to print the base for each piece. If you can rotate the cylinder freely inside the hole, you'll need to print the base slightly larger. If you can't fit the cylinder inside the hole at all, you'll need to print it smaller. The goal is to be able to fit the cylinder into the hole (some twisting may be required to find where it inserts), then twist it a bit to lock it into place.
Print one of each of the pokemon, and six of the bases (resized if necessary, as determined by the test above). At this size, mew's tail looks much better when printed with supports.
Print two of pokeball-half---one in white, one in red.
The tab that keeps the box closed is more prone to breaking off when printing the entire box as one piece, since the tab is built up vertically. You can risk this by printing box, or you can create a stronger tab by printing box-no-tab and tab-only, then gluing the tab onto the box. After printing the box, a small amount of force may be required to get the hinges to move freely. Use your fingernail to break of the supports inside the tab hole on the front of the box.
Use superglue (Loctite Superglue Ultra Gel Control works great) to attach the pokemon to the bases, and to attach the the pokeball halves to the lid of the box--they fit into the holes in the lid from the inside of the box.
Paint some eyes on the pokemon to give them a bit of life.

I didn't notice there was already a version of this in one piece, apologies. But since this version is different I decided to post it anyway. The two pieces of the coin put together, one version standing with a flat on the bottom. Works well with a raft, which if you left a bit in place after clean up, makes up for the flat. Printed fine at .075mm layer height.
Model has the same detail thickness as the original.
""2 Skull"" version has the skull on both sides TwoFace style.
There is also a necklace version.
Instructions
Print standing up with a raft. It might work without a raft but there is a fairly small area stuck to the table so failure is very likely without one. Standing the model up takes advantage of the higer z resolution so I recommend a low layer height. These were printed at .15 layer with skin half that height at .075mm.
Be cursed, until you can get the gold to Isla de Muertos.

A large flower inspired by the well-known Lego-flowers.
You can either print it in original scale so you get a x10 scale flower or scale it down by 50% to get a x5 scale one (that would e.g. match the wooden lego minifigure).
It's designed to be printed without supports.
There's also an alternative version of the flower available, that can be found here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4798812
The parts are interchangeable so you can create whatever flower type you like.
I uploaded a v2 of the stem to give it a cleaner look.
User b2vn made some nice accessories :)
Since people here don't care about the terms and conditions these models are released under, they won't be developed any further and there won't be similar uploads here.

Summary
This small print will be popular with everyone from your Mum, Sister, Girl Friend, Aunty etc. A quick easy and unique gift idea...
There are two types... one that has the side not attached to the keys that rotates / spins freely. The other type is a simple fixed key fob (no rotation / movement) and is the .stl titles 'solid'.. 
Pause your print part way through to create a unique Flower Fob in the colours of choice. Approximate colour change points 'with a 1mm Raft' are:
First Change: 4mm / 48%
Second Change: 8mm / 76%
Please refer to the print settings and images for additional details and to see the result...
Flower Fobs (with Raft) only use 6gm of filament and take half an hour to print (on a Replicator 2). At standard scale a Flower fob (excl. attachment end) is 30mm in diameter. 
The rotating type is a print-in-place design that does not require any automated support. A small support block has been designed in to support the Key Ring attachment. This should cut away relatively easily. Fine clearances are used so some machines may not be accurate enough to achieve a free spinning Flower Fob at standard scale. The simple solution to address this is uniformly scale it up a fraction to increase the clearances.
Note: If you like this check out all my other fun and practical designs.

Do not use automated support. This could build structures internally so the rotating type would not rotate. The one small piece of support required has been designed in. This should snap away relatively easily after printing (refer to images provided)

Post-Printing
Remove raft and designed-in support block.
Just cut the raft of, snap away the designed-in support block then wiggle the two halves (of the rotating type) to free your Flower Fob to spin.

This shape can turn in self watering flower pot or use just pentagonal shape as jewelry box.  
The  green-yellow-red think is water level indicator, it is falling from green to red as flower drinks water. The red means more water should be added.  
suggested scales [collection]
flower pot: 72%, 90%, 113%, 141%, 176%
jewelry box: 58%, 46%, 37%, 30%  
suggested surface  
both 90um and 190um looks great as this is simple shape to print, I have used low infill
without sanding it looks great, painted with metallic colors like gold or cooper-silver
sanded looks good in any color of material

I have tested this with Cura Daid on a RepRapPro printed at 0.1 layer height, 20% infill with 3 perimeters with Faberdashery PLA.  I had to slow the print way down on the final few layers to get the rim to finish correctly so make sure your minimum layer time is like 10 seconds.

Stick it on a flower pot to amaze everyone!  
UPDATE V2.5: Improved Handle. 50% Thinner blades to offer less wind resistance. New e-clips for better construction.
Design:
The other day I saw a big metal pinwheel at a local museum that created a cool optical illusion when it rotated, I loved it...
I returned home and began to work on my own printable design. It took many prototypes but I think I nailed it.  
The special twin blades rotate on opposite directions when the air hits them. The handle has a hole that fits a standard pencil so you can make it longer and stick it on your garden.  
Check out my other designs here: http://www.thingiverse.com/Dalpek/designs
Article from 3dprint.com: http://3dprint.com/48854/optical-illusion-pinwheel/
http://youtu.be/JVeFi31_f-s  
Instructions
Printing instructions:
The blades do not require supports.
The handle requires small supports.
DO NOT print the blades in different colors or you will loose the optical illusion effect!!
DO NOT print two A or two B blades, otherwise they will not spin correctly. A and B blades are very different, they are designed to rotate in opposite directions. 
If your slicer is not working with the blade's STLs then try to set your print layer height at 0.2mm or lower.
Assembly Instructions:  
1-Slide the blades to the pivots on the handle, making sure the flat sides of the blades are facing each other. Note: You might need to sand the pivots a little bit to make them as smooth as possible.  
2-Place the e-clips on the pivots and snap them in place at both ends.
You can add a drop of oil at the center of the blades to make them rotate smoothly.
Insert a pencil into the handle to make it longer.

Make your own unique one-of-a-kind flowers with this openSCAD file! Print beautiful flowers as a gift for that special someone, or just to help decorate your world. They print fast and easy (see instructions). Get creative and incorporate flowers into other models or for fashion (see picture of the tie jewelry).
The possibilities are HUGE - I have just scratched the surface and will upload my 9 favorite flowers (see ""Makes"" for notes on the settings).
I am exploring deliberately making drooloops, (I made that word up, droop+loop) and trying to harness the neat shapes you can get. This is my first attempt at something neat.
Please let me know how your prints turn out and post pics.
More drooloop objects:
jellyfish

Oh and if you like the black vase in my picts, i made with using PaulM's Customisable Spirograph Vase Generator
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53916
Instructions
These are really fun to design and print. Each print job is fun since there's a slight element of randomness. The randomness is because we are deliberately ""printing in the air"" to create the ""drooloops"" (droop+loop) that make these flowers look so amazing.
These slicer settings worked with 3 different printers I tried, and I bet will work with any slicers/printer if you use the models I have uploaded, or any customizer you make if you don't change settings on the advance tab of the customizer version.
ALL UNITS millimeters (mm)
layer_height = 0.2
wall_thickness = 0.8
solid_layer_thickness = 0.6
fill_density = 0
support = None
platform_adhesion = None
solid_top = False  (extra NOTE about solid_top: This is probably not your default setting....I use this so it will be hollow on top....for the pipe stem cleaner. I did not print the top, so this setting is kinda important to duplicate my results)
solid_bottom = True
Feel free to experiment and let everyone know if you find improvements or just interesting results. One person's ""interesting results"" may be another person's ""that exactly what I was looking for!"".
I was able to get these to print fine on the three different machine I have access to (Ultimaker1, MakerGear M2, and Type!Machines Series 1), but I bet you can get these out of any machine that is out there.
I will now go into gory details below. I learned a lot during this process and would like to share a few simple rules of thumb I use for the results I am getting, but I think all results look cool.
****(feel free to ignore everything below this line)****
Notes...about what I am doing to get more reliable and symmetrical results. If people think it would help, then I would also be happy to make some videos too.
NOTE ABOUT SLICER SETTINGS -(my 1st choice for slicing is CURA -it's free, slices better than anything I have used and works with everything as far as I can tell)  SO for a good clean drooloop you want the petals to print with no in-fill (see pictures). I like a simple drooloop to be formed by the nozzle leaving the center and coming back in a straight line and extruding the whole time (no retractions, or crazy infill motions). Look at your nozzle paths before you print to check this. If your slicer does not let you do this, then get one of the gcode viewers out there. I like hudborg's GCode Analyzer/Visualizer - http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35248
You can control the nozzle path and get these results by choosing model dimensions and slicer settings that compliment each other. For example make the petal width equal to the wall_thickness, so even if you are asking for infill none will be generated.
A quick way to dial in your slicer settings VS petal widths is to use a calibration comb where each tooth is a different width and they cover a range of widths. Get one here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:239255
I also want a nice thick drooloop so I never print finer that 0.2mm layer height. If you want to use different settings look at the advance setting area when generating your model.
FOR MORE SYMMETRICAL FLOWERS - TURN FAN OFF ONCE THE PETALS START PRINTING. If you don't turn off the fan it will be okay - your flowers may have a wind-blown effect since the petals may drift in the direction of the fan (see ""Makes"" for windy flowers). If you want,  you can turn off the fan by watching the printer and turning off the fan with your controller (if you have one), BUT my favorite method (since not all my printers have controllers, and I prefer to only constantly monitor my printers while the 1st layers are going down) is to quickly and simply modify the gcode file with a simple text editor. This way I can print a bunch and know it will always work. Using a basic text editor, open the gcode text file and make these changes:  
Turn off the fans on the layer just before the petals start to print. I usually add a comment to the layer name like ""mark turned off fans"" and then add right below that:
M106 S0
M107
This is kinda over kill, but i do it like that anyway.  You can get the layer number needed by simple math:
p_start_height/p_height=layer# petals start
OR by using the layer viewer.   
Search DOWN through the rest of the print looking for ""M106"" and just ""comment out"" those lines by adding a semicolon to the start of them...
so when you see:
M106 S58
you make it say:
;M106 S58
(Depending on your slicer, settings, model, etc..you may or may not find a lot of these fan speed commands. NOTE: Make sure the changes are in the ""petal printing area"", since a full-document search and replace may turn off the fan before you want it to.)
here's a video that will help make this more clear:
http://youtu.be/hYmclbTH7nw
UPDATE TO VIDEO - for MakerBot people the gcode is different. see this video for important details when using a MakerBot printer

Summary
The cloud ""rains"" down on the plant when watering. A reservoir at the bottom collects excess water and keeps the soil moist when you're away. A hidden slot in the arm allows for the mounting of an optional LED grow light.
Inspired by the Wall Flower Mount (Click) by 3DPVDB.
Optional:
I'm using this LED from eBay. It's supposed to be for 15V, but I'm running it just fine with a 12V power supply. I bought my power supply off a local shop, but any cheap power supply capable of supplying at least 500mA should do fine. Most plants would do just fine with 24hrs of light, but add a timer if you want to give your plants some rest.

Notes:
The cloud and arm are printed with normal PLA, while the main body and pot are printed with FormFutura EasyWood (Birch).
I printed without support, but had some droops on Pot.stl and part of Arm.stl. They do not affect functionality and are in a concealed position, but I'll print with support if I were to go again. If you plan to add a growlight, do not auto-add support for Arm.stl as it may block the cable passage!
Post-Printing
The parts are waterproof as printed with no special effort (tested). But I also painted the interior of the reservoir with a two part epoxy as an additional layer of protection. It's not strictly necessary, and there are many other ways to do it.
The cloud was painted over with white acrylic paint, as my white PLA has an ivory hue, and I didn't want to buy another roll of filament just for this print.

Summary
The Easter Egg Dispenser Bunny is a fun and decorative easy-to-print design for use over the Easter season. The Bunny features a 'flip-top' head so you can load mini chocolate Easter Eggs into an internal channel that runs around the back and out the bottom at the front. A 'stop' is designed in at the bottom to hold the Easter Eggs from rolling straight through so they can be 'dispensed' one at a time. When the presented Easter Egg is removed the rest shuffle down the internal channel so the next is ready to be dispensed... 
At standard scale he dispenser measures 150mm x 105mmx 35mm and will take mini chocolate Easter Eggs measuring up to 28mm x 22mm (The channel at standard size measures 30mm x 23.5mm allowing 1.5 to 2mm rolling clearance). If you have a large enough build plate the design can be scaled up uniformly to accept larger Easter Eggs. TIP: Please measure the Easter Eggs to be dispensed 'before' printing to ensure they will roll freely in the internal channel. If not, scale up to suit (Calculate the increase required including allowing for rolling clearance).
Make sure you roll your Easter Eggs in sideways so they roll through the internal channel. You may need to hold the first egg in (bottom egg) during loading otherwise following eggs being loaded may have enough momentum to knock the previously loaded eggs out (i.e. dispense them all at once). 
Before loading your Easter Eggs check the internal channel is free of print debris and as smooth as possible so the Easter Eggs inside can roll down with the minimum possible resistance. A well printed dispenser should have no/very few printing imperfections affecting the channel... but if you have some cut them away or sand smooth.  
Removing / dispensing Easter Eggs is easy... just gently remove the available egg. The remaining eggs inside will move down a space. Please note that removing eggs slowly / gently will ensure the remaining eggs inside cannot gain enough momentum to roll down and jump the retaining ridge / stop at the end of the channel (i.e. The retaining ridge could have been made bigger / taller but this makes the eggs harder to remove... so it is a trade-off between easy to remove eggs and eggs being well held in place).   
This is purely a fun Easter thing. It has been designed to be an easy one piece print with two components. The clearances applied are intentionally  loose so it should print well regardless of the slicing app or machine used (as not all slicing apps or machines produce the same results). 
The notch at the front side of the joint is purely for alignment purposes to help ensure the head sits straight in its lowered position.
Please note that the file has been updated in 2019 to strengthen the head / body linking pin as some people reported this part breaking when removing the print from the build plate or in use. It is still 3D printed plastic and a thin area but is stronger. 
2-PART VERSION: Lots of people with machines with small build plates asked for a way to print this design. For this reason two additional .stl's have been provided which allow the body and head to be printed separately then slotted together so the bunnies head flips open/closed as usual. Please download the 2part - A/B stl's for this requirement. Please also note that this version has not been test printed... but it should be fine as this is a minor revision to the original one-piece version which prints well every time.  
Great fun...print in you choice of color/s and make sure you have plenty mini Easter Eggs on hand. The hard part is keeping the Easter Egg Dispenser Bunny stocked with eggs!  
And, check out my Easter Egg Holder Bunnies as well. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1411956
Please refer to the print setting and images for additional information... and post images of your Easter Egg Dispenser Bunnies in use for others to see.

Supports:
No
Resolution:
Standard / 0.20mm
Infill:
PLA / 2 Shells / 15% recommended
Notes:
Easy print... no support required. Print flat on its side as per the design orientation.
At standard scale the Easter Egg Dispenser Bunny measures approx. 150mm tall, 105mm wide, and 35mm thick. Prints at this scale will use close to 100gm filament with the recommended print settings.
Scale up uniformly to fit larger Easter Eggs but scaling down is not recommended as it will mean common size Easter Eggs will not roll through the internal channel and the head / body joint be thinner so not as strong.
Post-Printing
Just add Easter Eggs...
Make sure you roll your Easter Eggs in sideways so they roll through the internal channel. You may need to support the first egg out (bottom egg) during loading otherwise following eggs being loaded may have enough momentum to knock them out... dispense them. 
Before loading your Easter Eggs check the internal channel is free of print debris and as smooth as possible so the Easter Eggs inside can roll down with the minimum possible resistance.  
Cute bunny... easy print and fun. The hard part will be keeping it stocked with your mini Easter Eggs!

Less than 10 percent of people who download an item click the “like” button. Be the 10 percent. Click the “like” button and show your support. 
If you find this model useful, feel free to buy me a coffee. 
Also check out my standard threaded egg and locking egg with key. 
It's a threaded dragon egg, great for Easter egg hunts, gifts, and geocaching.
The whole egg measures 63mm tall by 45mm wide (47mm if you count the scale width). This will scale fine up to 200 percent. If you want to print bigger than that, switch to the 300 percent version.
I also made a solid version.
This is a remix of my own threaded Easter egg. I made every bit of this from scratch, including the scales. I made the scales by importing a custom texture into a Blender brush and placing every scale one at a time, adjusting the size as I went. I designed it with Sketchup, Blender, and Meshmixer. (And Gimp for the scale alpha.)
If you like this design and want to show your support, you can share your make, leave a review, or buy me a coffee (via Paypal, Venmo, or CashApp). I appreciate your support.
You may sells PRINTS of this design, but you MAY NOT sell the digital files or share them on any repository. If you want to see them on a particular repository, message me, and I will add them myself. When you sell prints, please respect the Creative Commons - Attribution - Share Alike license and credit me on the sales page with a link to this page. Attribution is mandatory. 
Instructions:
Print the bottom and top pieces as oriented in the files. Supports are not required. I recommend a layer height of 0.2mm or smaller, wall thickness of 1.2mm, a bottom thickness of 0.6mm, and a top thickness of 0.8mm. Infill density of 12 percent or higher. I tried to allow for horizontal expansion in the design, so try printing first WITHOUT adjusting horizontal expansion or slicing tolerance or x/y compensation. If it prints too tight or too loose, then you can use one of those slicing features to compensate. Threads are notorious for being the hardest item to print, so please be patient. If you want to save time while testing, you can print the included calibration test instead of the full model.
Once printed, screw the threads in and out repeatedly to remove any stray particles. It may feel too tight on the first threading but should screw easily after ten seconds of doing this.
Note the small nubs near the threads. Refer to the pictures to see what I'm talking about. When the two nubs are parallel, you know you've got the proper alignment.

Summary
Inspired by a dragon's egg.. or what they could look like if you imagined one ;-)  
Design intended for dualstrusion, but monostruders, do not despair:
You can print ""Net"" or ""Surface"" as standalones.  
Circa 11 cm high, scale as needed.  
So there are two different models:
One where the pattern is embedded near the surface.  (Left)
And one where the pattern is completely embedded in the shell.  (Right)  
Instructions
Suitable for dual extrusion printers.
There are four files of which you only need two in one print:
Always use the ""Net"" stl and combine with either a one ""Surface"" OR ""Embedded"" stl
Please look at the split render to see the full difference.
There is a thin and a thicker version of the Surface shell, choose which one your printer can handle.
The 2mm is also a nice standalone print.

Summary
WARNING: This instrument is NOT easy to play. The principle is the same as blowing a flute or a bottle. You need to experiment with different angles and lips shape (embouchure). Those with experience of playing top-blown flute would find it slightly easier. It looks similar to the Japanese tsuchibue or South American ocarina, but ocarina has a whistle on top that makes it easier to make a sound. You are recommended to print an ocarina instead if you can't make a sound with a glass bottle. 
Print quality also affects the result. If there are a lot of threads in the middle, that will block the air flow and stop the sound. I've printed four of them myself and only three of them gives a good sound. It is recommended to try the 6cm version first. 
This is an ancient Chinese musical instrument called xun. Archeological findings of the instrument dates back to bronze or late stone age. Wikipedia has a description of its history: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xun_(instrument)
This instrument is blown at the top like you blow a flute or shakuhachi. Hold the egg vertically and place your lower lips on the edge of the top hole. Make a small round hole in the middle of your lips and the blowing angle is at around 45 degrees. The pitch can be controlled by opening the fingerholes. The 6cm smaller version has a higher pitch and contains 6 fingerholes. The 8cm version has a slightly lower pitch and contains 8 fingerholes. This might help about how to get the right lips shape to blow it:

How I Designed This
Project: Dragon Egg
Summary
This is a replica of a dragon egg based on the Game of Thrones. It has a slightly different shape than a bird's egg with both ends a bit more more symmetric. Also, it has scales manually put together one by one. 
How I Designed This
This was made using Thinkercad and took me around 6 hours to complete. Then, to make it more real, I used Meshmixer and added some imperfections to simulate exposure of thousands of years to the elements.
Project: Dragon Egg
Project Name
Dragon Egg from Game of Thrones
Overview & Background
In the HBO Game of Thrones series, Daenerys Targaryen receives three petrified dragon eggs from Illyrio as a weeding gift. After looking online, I found the eggs for sale in the HBO store; unfortunately they cost $99. I decided to design them from scratch for anyone to print
Objectives
To design a dragon egg that resembles as much as possible to a ""real"" dragon egg. You would learn optimizing parameters for properly slicing a basic 3D object.
Audiences
Anyone interested in fantasy. It's actually a nice activity for art class as there is opportunity to improve the appearance by painting the egg afterwards.
Subjects
Reading (as it's based on the Game of Thrones book)
Arts
Geometry
Skills Learned (Standards)
Slicing 3d files
Using 3d printer
Cleaning 3d printed model
Lesson/Activity
Download STL file
Open a 3D Slicer program
Ensure the object is centered
Open the Slicer options and choose the best numbers for the following parameters assuming we want a hollow egg with no infill:
Infill Density: ??
Adhesion Type: Brim
Support Type: Touching bed
Shell Thickness: ??
Overhang angle: ?? degrees
The egg can be printed with very little support as the bottom is a bit flat. I used transparent PLA and no Infill, which made the egg very light, but still resistant.
Duration
1/2 hour preparing and slicing
about 4 hour printing
Preparation
This needs printing filament, preferably White PLA
Having read or watch Game of Thrones
Some acrylic paint (red, black and  green)
References
There are many different types of dragons. Please research what type of dragon do these eggs belong to based on shape and colors
Rubric & Assessment
By the end of the exercise students would understand how to use infill, how overhang angles affect the end result, and a bit about fantasy.

Summary
Easter Egg Holder Bunnies are fun prints that add a unique, decorative and fun dimension to your Easter Eggs. 
Easter Eggs are all a similar shape but different manufacturers Eggs vary quite a lot. The Easter Egg Holder Bunnies can be scaled to suit almost any Easter Egg. Scaling is simple... just choose the .stl  closest in size to your egg/s. Two have been provided but both are the same width to keep the print time / filament usage down (otherwise big ones become a big / long print). When scaling it is important to scale uniformly to preserve the internal shaping so the egg in place. 
To scale just follow these steps...
(1) Accurately measure the total length of your Easter Egg
(2) Choose the .stl closest to your Easter Eggs length. 50mm and 65mm have been provided.
(3) Divide the length of your Easter Egg by the .stl files measurement (eg. 40mm egg divided into he 50mm .stl = 80% of standard scale)
(4) Scale your Easter Egg Holder Bunny before slicing / exporting the file
Following this simple process should enable you to uniformly scale the Easter Egg Bunny Holders to accommodate your Easter Eggs... 
Great fun and unique decorative prints for Easter...  Please refer to the images for additional information on scaling etc. And, post images of your Easter Egg Holder Bunnies in on display and in hiding! 
And, check out my Easter Egg Dispenser Bunnies as well. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2231030
Note: If you like this you can also download the basic bunny (pictured in gray on the main image) used in this design at http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1411956. And, take a look at the rest of my fun, novel and practical designs.    
Tips: Tips are not expected but are appreciated as they help offset my filament costs as much as anything else. However, as I live outside the USA tips cannot be sent to me via PayPal.Me as that service is not supported in my region and this is beyond Thingverse's control. If you feel like sending a tip please use regular PayPal and send it to muzz64nz@gmail.com and, to those who do,  thanks in advance!

Summary
The Egg Separator... separates eggs. Many recipes require the egg yolk to be separated from the white but, for some people, this isn't an easy thing to do. This is a handy little solution that completely separates the yolk from the white and into two separate containers. 
The Egg Separator differs from commercial products which are usually just one part. These products rely on the egg white passing through the base of the separator into a container below then moving the separator to another bowl to place the yolk into. The problem is the white often doesn't separate well from the yolk so additional intervention is required to complete the separation. In addition, when moving the separator from the bowl the white has run into to the second bowl the yolk is to be poured into, they are prone to dripping. 
The Egg Separator has three parts (base receives the egg white, center separator section and the top which receives the yolk) and deals with the above issues well by following the following simple process:
Remove the top from the egg shaped Egg Separator
Crack your egg over the Egg Separator center section and base
Some of the egg white will run into the base... but usually a portion of the white will stay attached to the yolk above
Gently / slowly rotate the centre section over the base (i.e. holding the base still) a couple of full turns. This will pass the still attached egg white past the 'wiper' section in the base and pull the bulk of the remaining white away from the yolk.... but be gentle so you don't tear / break the yolk
Place the top onto the Egg Separator and lift the top and center up together. This will lift the yolk away and leave the white in the base part
Flip the top and center section over gently and the yolk will be drop into the inverted top (now used as a container for the yolk).
The white and yolk are now separated and in two different containers.
Note: A small amount of white will always stay with the yolk but the majority will be separated
It's easy... and, even for people who have no problems separating egg yolks from the white, it is a convenient solution because the yolk and white get separated into two containers that are part of the Egg Separator. 
Is it food safe?
You be the judge on this point. Before use a post print check over is recommended to remove any loose fragments of filament then wash well in a sink with warm water and detergent. This has been used many times before posting with no known issues to date in this regard.

Summary
A rather whimsical egg cup shaped like a chick.
I looked at the existing egg cup designs on Thingiverse and rather liked http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7834 by bpijls. So I set out to design something similar for chicken eggs.
This model holds eggs that are 42-46mm diameter. To fit larger eggs, you can either scale the .stl model or edit the parts directly in Tinkercad https://tinkercad.com/things/hvw1rSKFOVa
Instructions
The overhang at the base of the cup can be difficult to print.
I succeeded to print with:
â€¢ 0.35 layer height
â€¢ 4 perimeter shells
â€¢ 35% infill using a concentric pattern
â€¢ switching the cooling fan on only after the first 20 layers
â€¢ no supports (but you might need them)
Oh, and be very gentle removing the cup from the build platform, many chick feet have been harmed in the making of this thing.

The parameter egginess effects the shapes propensity to look like an egg, with the value of 1 being most egg like.
If the term egginess is not precise enough for you, check this site as my formula is base on this decent explantion of an egg shaped curve.

Summary
This is based off a mid-60's (we're guessing) egg separator that works very well.  However it's now glued together with epoxy :)  At first I tried to ""clone it"" - but decided to make the bowl section more ""egg shaped"" and seems to seperate the egg better!
I wanted to make a replacement and came across Tinkercad (first 3d design ever)!  After 7 versions and a lot of plastic as I was trying to calibrate my Replicator at the same time, I came up with this.
You may wonder why the walls are so thick... you can easily remove the chalaza without touching the yoke - be very careful when removing this.
""Egg Separator"" is embossed on the back.
Instructions
Printed with 30% infill, 1 shell in Print-o-matic (2 shells total), full support no raft.  Since support material by default in Skeinforge goes left to right along the x-axis (unless you've changed it), rotate the egg separator 90 degrees counter clockwise/clockwise.
NOTE: The plastic/brass nozzles etc.. of 3D printers are not food safe please take this into consideration when printing this.  Everyone probably already knows this.  Lego is made from ABS and young children chew on them.  I personally do not see it being an issue.  If anyone is concerned about voids in their prints where water/egg could enter and grow mold, I would avoid printing this.
100% infill or an extra shell might make it safer against voids, however I have not done this and I do not know how it would turn out.
1) Print using the plastic of your choice (PLA is probably a better choice)
2) Carefully remove the support
3) File the mouth/spout area with a small file
4) Wet sand both inside and outside of the mouth/spout area (I used 400 & 600 grit)
5) Crack egg and slowly pour off the white
6) Optionally you use your finger to remove the Chalaza (removed for a more uniform texture in baking)
NOTE:  If your printing this you probably already know this... But the older the egg the more fragile the yoke is, the yoke should be almost round if it ""sags"" it's old and can break easily when trying to separate it.  If any sharp edges remain after printing smooth them out to avoid any egg damage.  Pictures with the egg in the separator are from v5 before I made the walls thicker.

How I Designed This
Summary
If you build things, squares are a must have tool. What if, instead of checking if your works is dead square, clamping it directly to a square for a good result : first time, any time ?
You can't always find Clamp It Squares in your local store. Especially in Europe. And if you finally find some, serious models will cost you about 10 bucks each ! 
The Clamp It Squares I designed are actually available in three sizes : Large, Midi and Mini. They will be useful in various kind of jobs, from light DIY jobs to serious furniture making.
One last advice : don't over-tight the clamps, as the job is well done, no joinery needs extra pressure.
Edit : Added a new size : the Clamp It Square Mini, for smallest jobs, expecialy designed for spring clamps.
Edit : If you're looking for holders for your clamping squares, I recommend Gromax's holder for midi size: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3135812
Edit : added a beefy version of the Clamp It Square mini, by onlytobeking.

Notes:
Use preferabily strong and stiff material, like ABS, PETG or PC. Don't use flexible filaments like Nylon ones, because you won't be able to maintain a trustable squareness. PLA is possible, but be aware PLA can explode without warnings when overtighted if the part have a low rate infill. My large Clamp It Square are made out PLA, 100% inflill with no issue.
My advice, don't be cheap with infill : think life time tool.
Edit : the Clamp It Square Mini size will probably don't need to stand high pressure. Otherhand, stick to at last 50% infill to be sure it stays in shape.
Post-Printing
Prevent work pieces marking !
Depending of your printer's accuracy, you may print artefacts and sharp corners. Look forward any print problem on the sides which can mark your clamped parts, and do a little deburring. 
How I Designed This
Life time tool wanted !
To me a tool must be trustable, first time, any time. I did a bunch of prototypes to get the right shape. Actualy the Clamp It Squares uses less material possible and allows any clamp shape to be used : 
I added a special feature. Someday you may want to apply extra pressure to the corner itself. Instead of needing another tool, I changed the shape to allow to secure a corner between two squares, with a single clamp. That clam won't need a huge amount of pressure, so I limited it to 28m (more than 1""). See below an exemple of clamping process. Believe me, that parts are not going anywhere.
Mini size added !
The Clamp It Square Mini is for smallest jobs
It's expecialy designed for spring clamps.

FIXED MISTAKE!!
As of 11/19/2020, i fixed the dimension of the vertical side as this one was 3mm shorter than the horizontal which caused a difference of 7º on the diagonal angle. Sorry about that!
Design of a two sided speed square 160mm x 160mm and for the ones that STILL uses imperial, i designed a 6"" x 6"" version as well.
160mm x 160mm
The upright side goes from 0cm to 15cm, with steps of 2mm.
The upright slot has two features, one makes it easy to scribe lines for steps of 5mm and 10mm, the other is for steps of 2.5mm and 7.5mm.
The bottom slot goes from 3cm to 8.5cm, with steps of 5mm.
The diagonal side are the angle in degrees from 5º to 85º, with steps of 5º.
The diagonal slot are the common rise over a 12 inches run, from 1"" to 30"".
6"" x 6""
The upright side goes from 0"" to 6"", with steps of 1/8"".
The upright slot has two features, one makes it easy to scribe lines for steps of 1/2"" and 1"", the other is for steps of 1/4"" and 3/4"".
The bottom slot goes from 1""1/4 to 3""1/4, with steps of 1/4"".
The diagonal side are the angle in degrees from 5º to 85º, with steps of 5º.
The diagonal slot are the common rise over a 12 inches run, from 1"" to 30"".

THIS IS NOT INVENTED BY ME. THIS IS INVENTED BY MARK MANGER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO VISIT GROPENER WEBSITE: "" https://www.gropener.com/ "". THERE YOU CAN BUY THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE OPENER MADE IN ALUMINUM. <<<  
GrOpener is the creation of Mark Manger, an Applied Artist from Denver, Colorado. Inspired by the stick & screw openers Mark encountered in Africa in the 1990′s, the GrOpener uses the same leverage principle, but in a form that allows a bottle to be opened through the act of grabbing it.  <<<  
This is super easy to print!  
Project video in Finnish (UPDATE: SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM_iu6JYxDA  
PRINT WITH SUPPORT MATERIAL (there is a little overhang!)  
My first ever 3D creation!  
Version 4 (updated 23.6.14):
Now there is 4 different editions:  
Edition one: Basic OHBO
Edition two: OHBO with a magnet.
Edition three: OHBO with a coin.
Edition four: OHBO with a magnet and a coin.
BTW: The back of the OHBO is for cans! Just stick the tail under the clip of the can to open it!
Magnets from dx.com (here is a link: http://www.dx.com/p/10050078w-round-ndfeb-magnets-silver-50-pcs-239991)   
Coin is a 1cent euro coin.  
You will also need some super glue if you are printing edition 2,3 or 4.   
All editions are right scaled and tested. At the slicing software rotation of the object is only required. I recommend to print with 100% infill (layer height 0.2mm) but my 20% infill opener is also tough enough to open a bottle!  
My prints are made of PLA, PLA/PHA and XT plastics! I like to see your prints of this model!
visit: https://www.youmagine.com/designs/smart-one-handed-bottle-opener-by-kart5a
Instructions
Printing tips:
Print always with support touching build plate! (There is a little overhang). I prefer to print this model with 100% infill. Also adding more outer perimeters helps. 4 Should do it.
Material:
For me this model works well with many of the plastics. I have tried PLA, Colorfabb PLA/PHA and Colorfabb XT (copolyester). ABS should work well as well but it might be a little too flexible (a part of the opening force goes to flexing so the opening process requires more force). I think PLA is awesome material to choose for this print!  
Steps:  
Print  
Glue the coin and the magnet or either. (Edition 2,3 and 4)  
Add a keychain or some string to the hole.  
!!! IMPORTANT !!!
Use super glue or epoxy and glue the coin as well as possible. The product has to be very solid. It won't break unless it is not solid enough. (I have printed so many of these and only one broke up caused by bad gluing.

My mother was diagnosed with Cushing syndrome over a year ago. Along with many other symptoms muscle deterioration is one of them. She has been treated and is on the road to recovery but she is still very weak. She was telling me that she had to go to her neighbors house so they could open up a bottle for her. She had a bottle opener but not one that would fit a large bottle. I went through a few different designs but now I have a working version.

Notes:
Please DO NOT use support material! This design is optimized for 3D printing and has no overhangs bigger than 45 degrees. Support material adds extra trouble because you have to make sure everything is removed and no loose parts will enter your drink.
Make sure your print is watertight, thus use enough outer shells. Otherwise juice will settle inside your print and mould will start to grow.

Summary
This design is a prototype of a purely printed bottle opener design, which means you don't need to add a coin or other metal parts for stability. It's designed to require minimum force and has maximum stability at the critical point (where the cap is lifted).  
My printed prototype withstood about 15 bottles of my favorite German beer until it broke. So the current version can only be seen as an ""emergency"" bottle opener but nothing which lasts long.  
An optimization to this as well as an alternative design (also without metal) is under development.  
Please read print instructions for good results!  
The model is designed in Blender with bezier spline curves, the Blender source file is also available for download.
Instructions
Print this with some extra shells, solid top and bottom layers as well as with not too low infill to reach a good stability. I used 0.3mm layer height, 3 shells and 5 full layers at top and bottom as well as 30% infill. I filed the surface after printing, which removes ~1 layer.  
I used ABS, but PLA might be even better (but I don't have any experience with PLA).  
You might want to file a bit off from the (in the picture) left part if you can't open a bottle with it. It's designed to perfectly fit the bottle cap, but if it is too tight it might not pass the glass once the cap is lifted a bit (see second picture).

Featured in Make Magazine's  Winter 2013 Ultimate Guide to 3D printing!
(March, 2019) This watering spout was originally designed and built on a Makerbot cupcake 3D printer. As such, the tolerances are loose and probably won't work for you if you use a modern 3D printer with its improved accuracy. I encourage you to take a look at the list of derivatives to find one that may better work for your printer. Thanks!
This is a watering spout for a 2L bottle or anything that can screw on to soda bottle threads. There is also a Autodesk Inventor file attached that has no threads, so you can adjust as you see fit.
The point here is that, thanks to the wonders of 3D printing, you can repurpose what would be a piece of trash into something useful. This spout would be useful for seedlings or other small plants that require measured amounts of water.  Also, this watering spout has 1/8"" thick walls. You can't buy something this durable at the store!
I've recently (May 2013) uploaded a modified design file that takes care of some sealing issues and adds threads to the bottle. I added the threads in with an assembly, so the STL file got a lot bigger in the process. It prints great, though.  If it still leaks, try taking the rubber gasket out of the  2 L cap, drilling it out and using it as a washer.  
Derivatives:
ljudmila changed up the threads:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10600  
Chickan put this on a watering hose:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:95723  
chickan also made one with different threads:

Summary
(Note:  There's now a better, tapered version.  I recommend that you print this instead: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:12348)
I was ashamed Thingiverse. So ashamed.  I presented the Mighty Bottle Opener as the pocket equivalent to Starno's Coin-Op.  It wasn't.  It isn't.  I just wasn't able to find a reliable way to protect the plastic.
It works really well if printed in PLA, but for the vast majority of users it's an annoying chewed-up mess.
WELL NO MORE!  After months of self recrimination, I went back to the drawing board, and have come back with a beefier ""church key"" design.
Two things that make me confident in this design:
1 - I've used it to open several bottles with ease. (Gasp!)
2 - I took the time to make the model fully parametric.  If it's not strong enough for you, you can make it 10 inches thick! (not recommended)
Another benefit to the parametric model is that it can be adjusted to fit the coin of your choice.  (See the attached image for some of what can be specified.  When I say ""fully parametric"" I mean FULLY)
Mighty Opener: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:9350
Starno's Coin-Op: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1842
UPDATE:  I've added the ability to sexify the opener with a makerbot M.  Just set the ""UseBadge"" flag in the scad.  if you'd like to use an M in your own OpenSCAD part, I've broken out the module I used to draw my M into its own thing: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11105
UPDATE #2:  These things make great gifts.  With a little tweaking you can print a custom design instead of the M.  I've detailed the process here: http://brettbeauregard.com/blog/2011/09/making-a-custom-bottle-opener/
Instructions
There's really only one thing to watch out for with this design. Because the slot is parallel to the build platform there's a long gap that needs to get bridged by plastic
1- Rotate the part such that the first layer above the opening runs across from plastic to plastic
2- If you're getting sagging/drooping, see the discussion below regarding bridge settings
A note about fill:  I set the fill ratio on my thingomatic to 0.9, which is essentially 100%.  Because of the relative thinness of the part, this isn't the time to skimp on plastic.
Coin Insertion:  It had not occurred to me that people might try to insert the coin by pausing mid-print.  Apparently this works, but it's not what I do.  After printing I slide the penny into the slot as far as I can.  then using a pair of pliers (one jaw on the penny, the other on the short edge of the opener,) I squeeze the penny in the rest of the way.

This is a model of the Space Shuttle that stands over 12"" high.   
It started out as this model from Google's 3D warehouse.   
http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=4c41b6547d241ffd9aa9d7f676c1fd7e&prevstart=0  
All the parts come apart so you can configure it in many ways.  
On the launch pad fully assembled  
Launched with boosters attached  
Boosters detached - just the Orbiter and fuel tank  
Orbiter by itself
Instructions
Print, print and then print some more!  
Tallest piece is about 115mm and the launch pad takes up nearly the entire build platform of a Thing-O-Matic.  
Printed with a layer height of .25mm, 0 extra shells and 10% infill. You may want to print the launch pad with extra shells to increase the strength of the posts.  
Each of the main parts, the Orbiter, boosters and fuel tank are comprised of three pieces each which are pinned together using bits of 3mm filament and glued. Gluing is optional, but recommended. I use acetone.  
Attach the Orbiter to the fuel tank using 3mm filament. If the filament fits too loosely you can crush it slightly with pliers to make it wider. Attach the boosters to the fuel tank in the same manner.  
The engine piece snaps into the back of the Orbiter and the nozzle pieces for the boosters press into place. A bit of sanding may be needed depending upon how flared out the bottom gets printed.  
Enjoy!

Summary
This is a highly detailed snap-fit (no glue required) model of a Saturn V rocket. Its modular design and included conversion ring makes it fully compatible with my Modular Snap-Fit Airship and Trireme Upgrade:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45295
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45305
Uploaded an optimized version on 1/21/2013. Version 3 has improved wall thicknesses on the shells for two loop printing on almost every layer. The resulting build is more sturdy and efficent. The individual pieces are now avilable as well.
Instructions
The Modular Snap-Fit Saturn V has been prototyped on a Replicator 2. It is designed for support free printing and has been prototyped as such. 
UPDATE: 1/31/2013
Version 3 is now online and it includes some improvements and optimizations. If you are a Replicator or Replicator2 user try slicing in MakerWare's Slice engine with .15mm layers and zero infill (not skeinforge). The latest prototype was sliced in this way and it took less than five minutes and the quality is comporable to a much slower Skinforge slice! I will post a more detailed MakerWare slice profile later.
Sliced in skeinforge it works best with the following settings in print-o-matic:
no support/raft
layer thickness: .15mm (or less)
Number of shells: 2 or 3 (This setting is very important to make the vertical prongs on the two middle sections strong enough to survive repeated snap-fitting)
feed speed: 80mm/s
travel speed: 150mm/s
fill rate: 0 (for shell version)
My actual slice profile is a little more complex but with print-o-matic those are the settings that will get you started. 
WARNING! Due to the high detail of the original solid model (B-rep made in autodesk Inventor) the resulting .stl surface mesh is very complex. Slicing can take a while even on high-spec machines. 
This shell version was designed to keep the material use to a minimum and works quite well but I am working on a solid version anyway. It might actually print faster at low rates of infill because there is less shell and perimeter to print even though they have been minimized in the shell version.
If you Saturn V comes out a little loose on the top and tail (like my last one did) I uploaded a quick fix so you can print a pair of shims that should tighten it up. They almost must be printed at .15 layers with the bottom layer at 100% thickness to work.
This model also replaces the tail and nose or hull sections of my Modular Snap-Fit Airship converting it into an Saturn V Airship! The included adaptder ring makes for a smooth transition between the airship and the S-IVb (top) section of the Saturn V. The same is true for the Trireme Hull!
Airship: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45295
Trireme: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45305
This is a work in progress for an art series I am working on so for the moment I licensed it as no-derivatives but I will open it up soon after I finish a few more parts.

Hot off the press .... 23rd December...just in time for Christmas.
This is the first ever tool emailed to space and printed in orbit!
I haven't even had time to print it yet, it's that hot.  
I found it here:
http://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/wrench-mis  
...but the file wouldn't download on either IE8 or Firefox.
It did download on Android, but wouldn't agree to being transmitted to a PC. Finally I made it work by zipping in Android and transmitting the .zip to the PC.  
I guess the engineers in Nasa, despite their brains the size of planets, forgot to change the file permissions?  
Anyway, here it is for all Earth-dwellers to enjoy!  
UPDATE:
I did a print in PLA on my K8200. 0.2mm layers.
I think the centre section is meant to turn and ratchet. But mine fused together :o(
Think the clearance needs to be increased for mere earth-bound printers.
YMMV....

Summary
This is a painting handle capable of holding miniatures with bases of 25mm as well as 32mm in diameter but not limited to this. The handle makes it much easier to hold a miniature during painting. It has 2 different slots for bases of different diameter. There is also a slot on the bottom where you could glue in a 10x1 magnet in order to stick it to some metallic surface (can lids?).
UPDATE 10 May 2018:
Version 3.3.3 uploaded. Many improvements are made to the design. Among them are:
Caps design is changed and is now less prone to breaks
Center point of the slot for 25mm bases is shifted so now bases are held much better
Pins are added to the sides of the handle so it is easier to open
All parts are oriented correctly so no need to rotate them before printing
Old version of the handle is available here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifzvas87bq0xauw/Painting_Handle_V3.1.zip?dl=0
UPDATE 10 March 2018:
Added 0.2mm chamfer to the handle to prevent formation of 'elephant foot'
UPDATE 5 March 2018:
gap between Handle and Platform increased from 0.2 to 0.3 mm
chamfers added to the Cap

To assemble the handle you would need a rubber band and a paper clip.
Assembling steps
make a hook out of paper clip. 
coil rubber band 3 or 4 times (I found 4 coils to work better but a bit harder to assemble) 
seize coiled rubber band with the hook on one cap (see the image above)
assemble handle and 2 platforms and pass paperclip hook through holes in them (see below)
grab the rubber band with the hook and pull it out from the other side
use something to fix the rubber band from another side and put the second cap on
Enjoy!

Update
Summary
Just a simple but sturdy and stylish all purpose handle (for furniture, cabinets, drawers, to carry boxes, electronic devices....) which comes in four flavors:
Small 100 mm (mounting holes: 85 mm)
Medium 120 mm (mounting holes: 100 mm)
Large 140 mm (mounting holes: 115 mm)
XLarge 170 mm (mounting holes: 140 mm)
PRINTING. Should be a simple print. No support or attachment needed. Print at any resolution and with any infill (use 50+% if you want it to be really strong). 
I use some cheap, easy to print carbon fiber PLA filament (looks great and adds that little extra strength - see photo above) but it also looks very good printed with Wood PLA filament (which in my experience is also sturdier than standard PLA -2nd photo above). Use two M3 - M4 screws to mount.
HOPE YOU LIKE IT AND IF YOU LIKE IT PLEASE LIKE IT. Thanks!
PS.: ..and in case you like it you may also like some of my other designs. Enjoy!
UPDATE 11 Oct 20: Added XLarge
UPDATE 26 Oct 2020: On request, here is the distance between centers of screw / mounting holes. The distances are 140, 115, 100, and 85 mm for XL. L, M, and S sizes, respectively, and the handles can easily be scaled (within reasonable limits) to get exactly the size / distance you need.  
Update

Simple T handle that requires no extra glue/screws/zip ties to assemble.  
Max size: 4mm hex key. (5/32 imperial)
Stem sizes are not critical just pick one slightly larger or the same as your hex key.  
Hex sizes:
1.5mm
2mm
2.5mm
3mm
4mm  
Compatible with the 5 hex keys from the Craftbot 3d printer.  
8-4-15: Updated Stems, increased thread tolerance by 0.125mm.  
Check out my other designs here:
http://www.thingiverse.com/Kezat/designs
Instructions
For the larger hex keys the bottom of the stem hole can be widened to allow the stem to seat farther down the hex key.   
If only one stem is printed at a time make sure it has good object cooling or print more then one at a time.  
Due to the design of the stem it may fall over during printing if the bed adhesion is not that great, adding a brim should solve that issue.

OLED Update 10/16/2021: Thanks to user astawiery! I've added one file for a V3 OLED switch version. The size of the new OLED switch is slightly different than the original. Thanks astawiery!!
Update 9/24/2021: Updated V3 files to include a ""Cleaned"" version by user CippyO. Thank you Cippy :). He removed a lot of imperfections from my Tinkercad work. 
Update 5/20/2021: I changed the lincense to attribution.
Update 5/21/2017: Added a new version (V3). I think it strikes the best balance between size, comfort and easy reach to shoulder buttons. I also updated the screenshots to easily see the differences. I included a split version of V3 for smaller printers.
Here is a great video of V3 being printed by ModBot: https://youtu.be/8MzNG5oqPlI He goes over what print settings were used and what it feels like to use it with the switch. Thanks, ModBot!
Update 5/4/2017: Added two new versions (V2A and V2B whole). Some people mentioned it was difficult to hit the shoulder buttons, so that inspired me to try and fix that in the next version. I ended up making one that was really compact (version V2B) and thought I need to make one that was in the middle ground (V2A). Check out the comparison screenshots. 
Original Text:
When you use the switch in portable mode for extended play sessions those hands start to cramp. I aimed for an Xbox style set of grips for the system while in portable mode. 
I took a previous model of a controller by ant385645 for the shape of the grips.
I included a split version for smaller print beds but keep in mind you might have to sand the connecting rails a little to make them fit. I would recommend getting the whole version as it will probably be much sturdier.
Make sure you print the whole thing (or all split pieces) standing upright so the support material is only on the bottom faces and it keeps the slot part for the tablet as smooth as possible.
Print Settings
Supports:
Yes
Notes:
Make sure it is printed standing up right like in the first picture. If it is printed face down, the slot will not be wide enough (because of sagging) and you'll use a lot more support material than needed.

Summary

I now release my improved model 2.0 of Allen Key Holder. It has better stability and does not release from the holder when pressed. Currently in four sizes. Personally, I like the new model better. The keys have a tight fit so you have to push them or use heat. I printed PLA with 0.2 resolution and 60% fill, no support needed. Enjoy!
The new STL-files are named hkeyX_x.stl
Handle for hexagon key gives better grip. Sizes 4 mm, 3 mm, 2.5 mm, 2 mm and 1.5 mm.
01182018 - Changed number ""3"" on allen key 3. ;-)

Summary
Universal handle for drills from 1.5 to 6 mm as well as screwdriver bits.
The designs available on Thingiverse either fit just single drill size or require printing a set of sockets for each drill size. I needed all-in-one adjustable handle. After a few ideas and iterations I ended up with this simple design.
Don't over tight the nut as it may crack along layers. It's not meant to keep drill as firmly as regular metal drill collet.
Updates:
v1.4 shortened nut, so that it does not stick out too far for bigger drill sizes
Print settings:
Filament: PETG, ABS, alternatively PLA, for arms I'd recommend even HIPS as it contains rubber and drill won't slip that much
Layer Height: 0.2
Line Width: 0.45
Wall Line Count: 2 (handle) and 3 (nut & arms)
Top/Bottom Layers: 3
Infill: 20%
Fill Gaps Between Walls: Nowhere
Cooling: 50-100%
Print speed: up to 50 mm/s

Just a simple geared knob for my CR-10 extruder.
Fits most printers with Nema17 stepper motors or generally with 5mm shafts.
An easy way to manipulate the feed and a nice visual tool to spot your retraction behavior.
It is a very very tight fight. You may want to upscale it by 0.5-2%
Update 01/03/2018
V2 High Clearance / Extended version
Added a high clearance version so you can check the filament rolling between the gear and the pulley.

A precision hobby knife that uses a standard utility blades instead of overpriced X-Acto ones.
An added benefit is that the blade can be reversed when it becomes dull; therefore, doubling the life of it.
The only additional hardware needed is a single 10mm m3 screw, m3 washer, and m3 nut.

See all our projects Here:
http://www.thingiverse.com/tag:relative_design
Instructions
Place a clean utility blade into the handle, making sure it is fully seated. 
Put the cover over the blade by first aligning the bottom edge under the small overhang and then pressing the top down over the blade. Again, make sure all parts are full seated.
Place the nut into the hexagonal hole in the cover. 
Complete the assembly by inserting the m3 screw with washer through the back face of the handle and into the nut. Tighten the screw snugly.

Summary
Using a file without a handle on is a potentially dangerous concept, what with this spike being moved around rapidly in front of you and with great force, often in the squishy part of your palm. Much safer and more comfortable to use a handle on it. Also you can hang them up with the loop provided in the handle, or use the handle to stop them dropping through your tool rack.
Two sizes are provided as STL's below in the traditional manner; too big, and too small. Fortunately they scale well. You can see it in use at 2:20 in this video: https://youtu.be/riJ47nAv7Bs
Instructions
Print, bludgeon spiky end of file into star-shaped hole in the handle. If you are sure you're not going to want to swap the handle, warm up the spike or add glue to ensure a permanent fix. Generally though, whacking it in works.
Because it's tall and thin you will probably want to use a raft to ensure good base adhesion. If printing small ones, you may want to print two at a time or the skinny bit may well blob.

Summary
This is a customizer for creating arc shaped cabinet handles or drawer handles.There are two basic styles that can be created: cylindrical and spheroidal.
The design is 3D-printer friendly: no supports are needed except for spheroidal handles with really large X and Y dimensions (length and clearance) and a really short Z dimension (height).
All dimension parameters, except for the tolerance parameters, are shown in the second picture. The customizer can optionally create nut holes for inserting nuts into the handle for the screws to screw into. The nut holes are visible in the vertical yellow handle in the first picture. The customizer can create plugs for the nut holes in case you are mounting them vertically and want to hide the holes.
It can also create a smaller test piece so that you can test the sizing of the holes to make sure that the holes will be sized well for the screws and nuts. 
The funky looking green handle second from the bottom wasn't directly created by the customizer; it's just a merged model of the handle above it and the handle below it.
The customizer will create 1) the handle, 2) the test piece, or 3) the nut hole plugs. To simplify viewing of this thing, the third STL has all three of these options combined into a single STL file.
Using the Customizer
Thingiverse hadn't run their customizer queue from Jul 10, 2020 to Aug 4, 2022 and may stop running it at any time again, so if they don't process your customized job, you will have to install and run OpenSCAD (free software) on your own computer to process the code to create your own customized models. See DrLex's instructions linked below for further details.
How to Run Customizer on Your Own Computer
Update 2019-11-22: Version 2
There is now support for a back-plate, such as in the red, cyan, magenta, teal, and steel blue handles. 
In addition to the handles shaped like a cylindrical section, the customizer can also create handles shaped like a spheroidal section, such as the orange, white, and gold handles. The height/clearance ratio determines whether or not the spheroid is oblate or prolate. If the ratio is less than 1 it's oblate like the orange handle, if it's greater than 1 it's prolate like the gold handle, and if it's equal to 1 it's a sphere like the white handle. The actual height will be the specified height plus the length of the fillet radius.
There is a now a parameter for the number of screw holes, which can be 1 or 2. If 1 is selected, then it will be centered on the handle and the parameter for distance between screw holes will be ignored.

Summary
Face it, filing plastic models is a fact of life when you work with a 3D printer. This is tedious work, which can leave your hand but a withered claw!  
This object is an ergonomic handle for small ""hobby"" or needle files which are commonly used to finish 3D-printed models. The cross section is a Relaux triangle, which is slightly sculpted in order to provide  a pencil-style grip which enables fine control and reduces fatigue. .   
These handles are designed to fit needle files with a cylindrical shank 3mm in diamter. Examples include http://www.homedepot.com/p/Nicholson-5-1-2-in-Assorted-Hobby-Craft-Mini-File-Set-6-Piece-42030L/203336567 and http://www.amazon.com/Nicholson-Piece-Hobby-Carded-Length/dp/B00002N5JT. Additionally, the handles may be scaled in order to fit other sizes and types of files.  
In addition to the file handles, a matching stand is also provided. It holds the files securely and arranges them for easy access. A center cavity in the stand can be used to store another tool which you are always reaching for, such as a pair of tweezers.  
I hope someone will find these useful, print them out, and upload a few photos. I'm not a very good hand model, I'm afraid. 
Instructions
Both the file handles and the stands should be printed in the given orientations. The file handle model features a thin disk which promotes better adhesion to the build surface; it should be easy to remove with a knife, machete, or oxygen torch. No supports should be used to print either the file handle or base.  
The handles are assembled onto the files by a press fit. I have hand the best results by clamping the cutting surface of the file vertically between two pieces of wood in a bench vise, and hammering the handle down onto the file. If you have a propane torch, assembly can be greatly eased by heating the file shank (but be careful not to anneal the cutting edges!)

Backpack Handle
A very simple, yet incredibly useful little device. Just slide this little gimmick on to the strap and it gets so much easier to carry that backpack when it is not on your shoulders. 
As you can't always carry your backpack on your back most packs come with some narrow strap loop attached to the top of the pack, which allows for it to be lifted (with usually just 3 fingers), and which... yes... tends to cut into your fingers (I am a hiker, so I know what I am talking about). This handle simply slides over the strap and provides a strong and ergonomic grip. It stays in place but can also easily be removed whenever needed. I have now attached this to all my hiking backpacks as well as day packs. 
FILAMENT
Use something really strong (PLA, PETG, ABS, whatever your favorite). I use this easy to print Carbon Fiber PLA , which gives a really tough print.
PRINTING
Printing is super easy. No supports needed. I use 30% infill and 0.25 mm layers. Printing time for the full set should be somewhere around 1 hr.
HOPE YOU LIKE THEM, AND IF YOU LIKE THEM, PLEASE LIKE THEM. THANKS!
Enjoy and happy printing!

Summary
Sometimes you just need an extra screwdriver, and if you are like me you have hundreds of small hex drivers around that never seem to wear out.  
This is a small and simple handle just big enough to make those bits useful, but not big enough to take up a bunch of space in your drawer or pocket.
Instructions
The handles hex slot is designed slightly undersized for molding the bit into the handle while the plastic is still warm and pliable. To do this just press the hex bit into the handle immediately after the print ends, and roll the opening between your fingers while it is cooling.  
With this method, you will get a snug and secure fit. I've found that my copies hold onto the bit well during use, but are still easy to change.  
If you are printing multiple handles, or you don't want to mold your handle, you may need to scale this up by 2-5% (depending on snugness desired)  
For a more permanent solution, only scale up to 1-3%, let the handle cool, and hammer your bit in.  
Print and enjoy!

Update from 2021-05-29
For easier printing the orientation of the 8.45mm version is now ""ready to print"".
To cover previous requests and prevent confusion I uploaded all STL files with new names. They are now named after the dimensions: heigth x length
In addition there is now a picture for reference what these measurements mean. It shows the original handle (8.45x55.2mm). Every other version is some kind of remix made from this one. So the provided source file just contains the original.
Update from 2021-05-21
There is now a slimmer version available addressing the concerns that the V-Slot wheel might be affected by some ""brake effekt"". The height of th orignal clamp is 8.45mm and the slim version offers just 5mm height.
This is a pretty simple handle for the print bed of an Ender3v2 which will fit previous versions as well I assume. My design comes up with a ""snap-on solution"" that gets mounted on the left front wheel of the Y-axis carrier. It will need some force since it sits really tight on the shaft.
The base idea contains the aspects of
easy to print
installation without tools and within seconds
decent
no restrictions to bed movement or attached stuff (cameras, lights, etc.)
just something to grab on for push / pull movement while the bed is hotter as 60°C
maybe a bit pivotable
So, what's the story behind this?
From my current point of view (or needs) most handles available here
get attached to bed leveling screws
require disassemble and / or new leveling of the bed
are bulky or big
take a lot of room or filament
are sometimes difficult to print
have other restrictions
This thing was made to work and not to look nice.
As usual the SketchUp file is included so you can modify it for your own needs. Longer shaft, smoother edges, different grip design, whatever... just go for it :)

Handles for GoPro to make it easier to use unmounted. Both have a small hoop for attaching a lanyard/wriststrap.
Instructions
Prints fine without support or raft on my Rep 2, your milage may vary. Printed with custom profile at 340 micron, 3 shells and 10% hexagonal infill. The nut-insert is a bit tight, 30 seconds of scraping with something sharp should fix that. I like it this way, less chance of the nut falling out.  
GoPro_Handle2.STL is with the slip-guard.  
Update January 19th 2015: If you want to print this without support you will need to rotate the part to lay flat along the front face. If you look at the pictures you'll see the side where the GoPro-lens is facing is the side that should lay flat on the bed. My CAD-software has a different opinion about what is ""up"" than Makerware.

Stone wall
This is my rural stone wall. It is intended for the 28mm scale and each segment is roughly 10cm (4 inches) long. There are four different segments right now but more are planned. Please comment if you have any suggestions.
Post-Printing
Do as much smoothing as you like (acetone with ABS).
Paint it dark gray with acrylic paint.
Drybrush it with a medium gray acrylic paint.
Paint it generously with watered down brown acrylic paint.
Add a second drybrush (lighter) with a light gray.
Do as many steps as you want with drybrush and lighter and lighter colors.
Paint the base the same color as your gaming surface (green).
Or, paint it with PVA glue and sprinkle flock over it.

This Gearbox Keychain has two working gears. They spin smoothly and have a gear ratio of 1.5:1 (12:8). Other ratios will be uploaded soon! Use a little lube to make it run even smoother!  
As always, we don't like wasting material, so we designed it in a way that you won't need any support material.

I wanted to make my own Swiss Army style keychain.  
This 2nd version is quite a bit smaller than the first one I did.  I added my own take on the swiss army logo.   
Instructions
Use 3 3mm socket cap screws (length depends on how many keys you want to use) and nuts (sized for 3mm nylocks), assorted washers.  
Using washers will make the keys easier to pull out and get a decent snugness. But you could lose them if you wanted a smaller overall thickness.

Tips are now now graciously accepted.  (and might just lure me back to doing 3D work again)
If you print it, please consider posting your Make a small token of  gratitude.  (or if you print a bunch how about a tip?) https://www.thingiverse.com/urbanatwork/about#tip
I've been looking at a necklace version... but my real job has been busy busy.  
Quick note : I found a very small deformation on the axle of one of the models uploaded. I should be able to add it to the next tweak. Thanks for posting all the Makes and positive feedback!  
UPDATE (2015-06-02) : I added a new version of the large gap model that was causing some printers to print usual bridging at the top layer of the model. If your printer isn't perfectly dialed in or this is your first try at printing this model then use this version first: http://www.thingiverse.com/download:1366134  
UPDATE (2015-02-08) : I added a ""new"" version that has a larger gap around the axles to try and address the issue some are having (including me) with the first layers fusing (especially with PLA). Let me know how it works, thanks.  
UPDATE (2015-02-05) : I added a version (GearedHeartV1_5-wGearHoles.stl) that has holes in the gears and axels ... as requested by a couple users (to make it easier to turn with a pencil tip or paperclip).   
Description: So you've been busy tinkering in the lab all day and forgot to get something for that someone special. If you've got a nicely leveled 3D printer you could quickly print one of these cute keychains... of course you have to say something beautifully sappy like:
... ""You're the gear on the left and I'm the gear on the right, and the gear at the bottom is our love that keeps us in sync...""   
And if that doesn't work, well good luck to ya!   
Inspired by Emmett's awesome single print Gear Bearing, his Heart Gears (which takes a while to print and put together) and Umake's Gearbox Keychain.   
I set out to make keychain that has moving gears but in a single print inside of a heart.   
Note to PLA users:
Let the print cool before removing from the plate. You don't want the gear and axle to stick while hot and fuse.   
Newest Version has rounded size and bigger hole for the keychain.  
I also added both of the original, no holes, files separately so you can dual print it. It worked well. the ""natural"" and pink one is a dual print.

Make sure you print it with the gear faces down.   
I have had the best luck printing this in ABS on a Makerbot Dual and 2X, but we have had some nice prints from our Ultimaker in PLA.   
I've been printing with:  
10-15% fill  
2 Shells  
0.2 Layer Height  
NO SUPPORTS (pfft)  
NO RAFT  (ain't got time for that :)

This propeller keychain consists out of two pieces. The case and the propeller itself. You obviously need one of both pieces to make the keychain.   
The propeller has one side that sticks out. That side has to be mounted to the bottom of the case. So, towards the side that connects the inside with the outside. A little lube will make the propeller turn a lot smoother.

This is an easy to print one piece utility blade holder with a 6 cm ruler. The tool could be used for light cutting tasks and could be clipped to a keychain for everyday carry. 
There are 2 versions for this design. One has a solid body for added rigidity and the other has a finger groove for easier deployment. Both versions also have an alternate file where the lockbar is extended further to accomodate larger stanley blades as the general dimensions of each brand of blade may vary slightly.
WARNING: It is not advised to apply too much force on the tool when cutting larger or tougher items as the tool may fail under large pressure. This tool is designed for light cutting tasks only.

That's no moon!
Just print the 2 parts and glue it together.
Print at 0.1 or 0.2mm, with an infill of 50% min, it's better if the ball is heavy.
The ring must be printed very slowly to be strong.
The design is not as neat as other DeathStars found here cause this one is designed to be printed as a small object, the lines has to be bold.
EDIT 04/2017 : The object has been updated with these modifications:
-The hook is fatter, it should be more sturdy
-Remove holes under the objects
-The scale is now 85% of the original version, it was too big for a keychain I think

Hello, a light version is available. : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2396619
Enjoy !
MISE À JOUR / UPDATE - 27-01-2017
Modification de la pièce ""router plate"", l'espace entre les molettes et les montants sur les côtés a été augmenté de façon à ne pas gêner les molettes lorsque la plaque est entièrement remontée. La pièce d'origine est remplacée par la V2.
Modification of the part “router plate”, space between the knobs and the amounts on the sides was increased in order not to obstruct the knobs when the plate went up. The original part is replaced by V2.
English version is below
Le Push Block est un outil indispensable pour tous ceux qui utilisent une scie circulaire ou une défonceuse sous table. Il permet de pousser le morceau de bois qui doit être travaillé en toute sécurité pour vos mains.
-- IMPORTANT --Il s'agit là d'un outil de sécurité. Je ne suis pas ingénieur, mais un simple utilisateur d'imprimante 3D et à ce titre, si vous deviez vous blesser à cause du Push Block, ni moi ni Thingiverse ne pourrions être responsable. Si vous décidez d'imprimer le Push Block, vous prenez seul la responsabilité de l'utiliser à vos risques et périls.
Afin de mieux comprendre le fonctionnement de cet outil, je vous invite à visionner les vidéos suivantes :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZdJEEyZ07w
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fMamibyp2k
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE7xYu_DR_Q
Modifications apportées :
La poignée est ergonomique et peut être tournée suivant un angle de ±15°
la petite pièce nommée ""tail"" se glisse à l'arrière de la pièce ""bottom"". Elle permet de pousser automatiquement l'extrémité de la pièce en bois. Pour cela, elle doit pouvoir coulisser librement, n'hésitez pas à la poncer un petit peut si cela n'était pas le cas.
Conseils pour l'impression:
Il n'y a aucune difficulté à imprimer chaque élément, aucun pont n'est présent et aucun support n'est nécessaire. Il vous suffit d'imprimer les pièces comme présentées sous Thingiverse.
Cependant, pour certaines pièces, et en particulier pour les pièces ""Main"" et ""Stabilizing Plate"", vous risquez d'avoir un phénomène de warping. Un bon réglage du plateau avec un brim ou un raft sera peut être nécessaire.
Le Push Block est un gros bébé et à ce titre, prévoyez pas mal de filament et beaucoup de patience pour imprimer l'ensemble.
Montage:
Avant de commencer le montage, utilisez une filière de Ø4 mm pour usiner les 4 pas de vis situés de chaque côté de la pièce principale. Si vous ne possédez pas de filière, vous pouvez visser directement, mais je n'aime pas cette méthode.
Montez le Push Block en suivant l'ordre des images.
Nota : les molettes de serrage on étés réalisées grâce au modèle proposé par Thehans () que vous trouverez ici -> http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1562501. Franchement , c'est vraiment un super boulot, les modifications se font facilement et je vous recommande cet objet si vous avez des molettes à réaliser. Cependant, les emplacements pour les écrous qui vont dans ces molettes sont vraiment très ajustés, ils devront donc être rentrés à l'aide d'un fer à souder.
À noter également que la molette arrière est différente des autres (Knob bottom back).
Liste des éléments à imprimer (merci dflash0) :
1 x Knob_bottom_back
6 x knob

1 x handle
1 x Main
2 x Insert
1 x bottom
1 x router plate

J'espère que cet outil vous sera utile, bon bricolage !
Si cet objet vous plait, vous pouvez me payer une bière ou un café (tip designer). Merci ;)
English version
(sorry for my poor English)
The Push Block is a useful tool for all those which use a circular saw or a router under the table. It makes it possible to push a piece of wood which must be cut in full safety for your hands.
-- WARNING --It is security tool. I am not an engineer, but a simple user of 3D printer and for this reason, if you injury you because of Push Block, neither me nor Thingiverse let us can be responsible. If you decide to print the Push Block, you take the responsibility to use it at your risks.
To better understand the functionality of this tool, look at the videos.
Modifications which I made :
The handle is ergonomic and can be turned according to an angle of ±15°
The small part named “tail” slips in the part “bottom” in the back. It makes it possible automatically to push the end of the piece of wood. For that, it must be able to slide freely, do not hesitate to sandpaper it a little if that were not the case.
Tips for the print:
It has no difficulty there in print all elements, no bridge and no support is necessary, just print them as presented with Thingiverse.
However, for certain parts and in particular for the parts “Main” and “Stabilizing plate”, you could have a warping. A good adjustment of the bed with a brim or a raft will be necessary.
Push Block is a big baby and for this reason, envisage enough filament and much of patience to print all this stuff.
Assembly:
Before beginning the assembly, use a tap of Ø4 mm to make 4 threads located on each side of the main part. If you do not have a tap, you can screw directly, but I do not like this method.
Assemble Push Block while following the order of the pictures.
Nota: knobs are realized with the model suggested by Thehans () which you will find here - > http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1562501.Honestly, it is a great job, the modifications are done easily and I you recommend it if you have knobs to realize. However, the holes for the nuts are very adjusted, put them with a soldering iron.
To also note that the back knob is different from other (Knob bottom back).
You must print (thanks dflash0) :
1 x Knob_bottom_back
6 x knob
2 x Side
1 x handle
1 x Main
2 x Insert
1 x bottom
1 x router plate
1 x Stabilizing plate
1 x Tail
1 x side plate
BOM: 
Ø4 mm tap (optional) to fix the sides
2 screws M5×30/35 mm with cruciform head for the handle
2 M5 nuts for the handle
8 screws TBHC BASE PLATE M4X16 STAINLESS A2 for the sides (http://www.visseriefixations.fr/tbhc-embase-m4x16-inox-a2.html)
6 bolts HT M4X20 for the knobs (http://www.visseriefixations.fr/vis-a-tete-hexagonale/vis-a-tete-hexagonale-standard/inox-a2/th-inox-a2-filetage-total-din-933.html)
6 M4 nuts for the knobs
A non-skid coating to place in lower part. I found this plate in a store of do-it-yourself and that seems well to function : http://www.leroymerlin.fr/v3/p/produits/plaque-en-caoutchouc-290-x-210-mm-e1400037406?queryredirect=a_fp_plaque_en_caoutchouc__290_x_210_mm&numpage=1
I hope that this tool will be useful !

Modern design of the famous Super Mario Bros Question Block!
Easy to print (no support need at all) with good results.
The block dimensions are 10 x 10 x 10cm (3.9 x 3.9 x 3.9"") at 100% scale.
I recommend to print a 80% scale if you want the SD Cards / Switch cartridges version (slots dimensions are designed to fit perfectly at that scale).
Customizable: depending on the printed parts, you can use it like a coin box, a storage box, a SD cards / Switch cartridges optimized storage, or even a desk lamp!
Two types of storage are available:
Type 1 - For Switch cartridges / SD Cards, Micro-SD Cards and generic storage spaces
Type 2 - Simple storage space
/!\ Caution: if you use the Type 1 configuration, you must change the scale of all parts to 80% /!\
Desk Shrooms seen on the first picture (thing:1375575) is designed by AndrewBougie.

This is a mini-sanding block I designed to help me with leather projects. I liked the size and versatility of it, so I wanted to share with anyone else who could use this for small, detailed work. It will accommodate most any sandpaper. I used 9-inch sheets and cut them to 1.5-inch strips to fit. The width of this is 1.5 inches, but can be easily modified for larger or smaller strips. 
I used an Elegoo Mars to print this, but it should work for FDM printers as well. (Image printed with Siraya Tech Fast, 0.05mm).
Assembly is straightforward, and should not require any hand tools, but holes may shrink a bit depending on your machine..

How I Designed This
Summary
This is a ? block from the Mario universe!
Print Settings
Printer brand:
MakerBot
Printer:
MakerBot Replicator (5th Generation)
Rafts:
Doesn't Matter
Supports:
No
Infill:
10 - 15%
Notes:
I printed mine with a raft, no supports, .2mm layer height, 215C PLA, and 15% infill.
I used a 15% infill because the difference in plastic used and print time were minimal, but a 10% infill would likely be more than enough. The undersides of the question marks drooped a little without supports, but not enough to really notice. I also printed this with a raft, but I don't think it would make a difference.
How I Designed This
When designing this block I tried to match the original Mario question block design as close as possible.  In Solidworks, I started with a perfect cube, created one side with a protruding question mark and four circles, beveled all of the edges, and then copied it to the remaining three sides.  The print may appear to be uneven because the x and y are equal while the z measurement is shorter, but this is simply because the top and bottom of the cube are flat (do not contain protruding question marks) while the other four sides are not.

Print at about 20% infil, it doesn't need to be very dense, but it may need a good thick solid outer layer to handle any stress you put on it while sanding, I used a 1mm thick perimeter (about 5 solid layers with 3 perimeters at 0.2mm layer height).
It takes a strip of sandpaper about 1 inch wide and 9 inches long.  Make a fold about 1/4 inch deep into one side and then double the fold to make the paper thicker on that end.  Insert that end into the smaller slot on the block and then wrap the rests around until it reaches the larger slot.  Use the wedge to wedge this end into the slot.
To use it, just rest it in the palm of your hand with your thumb on the wedge for leverage.

Summary
1-2-3 blocks (aka setup blocks) are a highly configurable drill press and milling fixture. They are most useful when you need a straight edge or a fixed support surface. Normal 123 blocks are made of hardened steel ground perfectly square and flat. This is intended to be a cost effective & disposable version. (Steel blocks on amazon for comparison: http://amzn.to/28PFOgM)
The block dimensions are 1” x 2” x 3”. The holes (5/16"") are used to fasten the blocks to each other or to your table.
Setup blocks go along nicely with step blocks (clamp set): http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:50512
Instructions
Print with rectilinear infill at 30% minimum.  The clamp uses a 5/16 nut pressed into place.  
I recommend purchasing a 24"" length of 5/16"" threaded rod and cutting it into (2)-5"" pieces, and (4)-3"" pieces.

This thing won 3rd place in the Thingiverse / GE Firstbuild
'Countertop Challenge'   
https://firstbuild.com/blog/post/countertop-challenge-winners/299/  
This is my entry in GE Firstbuild's 'Countertop Challenge'  
The ‘micro-BLOCK’ is a tribute to the micro-KITCHEN and offers an organized, compact, and aesthetic way to keep your most important cooking and baking instruments  easily accessible right on the countertop.  Its great for kitchens that may not have a lot of drawer space and awesome for connected kitchens of the future.  The micro-BLOCK’s best forward-thinking feature is an embedded  touchscreen device which is meant to serve as your connected kitchen’s control panel and an access point for Green-Bean enhanced appliances.   You could also use the display to stream how-to cooking video’s, or any other functionality a killer kitchen app might provide.  The micro-BLOCK also has a convenient ledge  to hold your tablet up off the messy countertop at the perfect recipe-reading angle.
The micro-BLOCK provides storage for all these common cooking and baking instruments. Not everyone's tools are the same but the micro-BLOCK is designed with enough flexibility to accommodate  most common sizes and form factors .

Summary
This is the CaliBlock (calibration + block). It's a calibration print that can be also used as a nifty building toy. If your printer is reasonably well-calibrated, CaliBlocks will snap together much like Legos. No pins or screws required.
TAKE THE 1 HOUR CALIBLOCK CHALLENGE! Try to print a ""caliblock normal half"" in less than one hour. It's a challenge for most printers! You must meet the following conditions: 
Be honest! Nobody likes cheaters.
Actual recorded print time must be less than 1 hour, slicer estimates don't count.
No scaling, final dimensions must be +/-1% of the targets.
1-hour CaliBlocks must clip and unclip with other CaliBlock without breaking.
Post a close-up ""make"" photo of the print along with your printer model and slicer settings to prove you did it.
If you succeed, you get a million 3D printer points!
Version history:
Rev 5: initial upload
Rev 6: Beveled corners on clips to make it less sharp on hands
Rev 7: Beveled some corners at the base of half blocks to further reduce sharpness
Rev 7b: Added ""tight fit"" option to reduce play for people with super-precise printers (from 0.3mm per clip to 0.1mm per clip)
This was inspired by the 3D Benchy boat (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:763622). Calibration prints should be fun! This print is great for:
Overhangs... it's chockablock full of 'em. But all overhangs are less than 60 degrees so it's completely printable without support!
Retraction... there are SO many retractions. SO MANY.
Print strength... if the clips snap off, your print is too weak! The model geometry is specifically oriented to maximize clip strength.
Dimension tolerance... the clips should be a snug snap-fit but also removable and reusable. If you're crazy over-extruding, it won't go together. Also, the square faces are 20x20mm with a 12x12mm hole and the edge-to-edge length is 60mm,
Ringing and position registration... it's got tons of great sharp turns to shake your printer!
I strongly recommend printing two ""halves"" and gluing them together. No support required. But if you want to work on supports too, go ahead and try to print the ""whole"" model in one go. It should be good for testing dissolvable filaments and different slicer support types.
Note: I came up with the idea independently, but I want to give credit to the BUBO block for beating me to the punch with a very similar toy shape: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:685490

Notes:
I strongly recommend PETG or ABS or other filament with a little bit of flex to it. PLA is often too brittle for repeated use of snap-fit components. But it can be done quite easily, I have printed a bunch.
Use your best overhang settings: small layer heights with print cooling suitable for your chosen filament.
Extrusion width should probably be 0.6mm or less, I've been printing at 0.6 and 0.4 with good results.
Infill IS required, but can be light (eg ~10-30% depending on pattern).
After printing two halves, make sure the snaps fit together. And then if you want, glue them together flat-to-flat. You'll have to pick a glue appropriate to your plastic, but regular superglue should work ok with most materials. I've been using Loctite 401. It sets very fast, but it's great for difficult-to-glue plastics.

Kurt Naef's Building Blocks (1955) were among the first of his designs for children and a core component of his Basel-based companyâ€™s educational philosophy. These blocks can be stacked and nested to form staggered constructionsâ€”bridges and towers, for instanceâ€”stimulating a childâ€™s creativity. Ages 3 and up.

This 3D printed glock block should make taking your glock or polymer80 apart way easier. Been looking for one of these tools but couldn't justify what they were asking. Print it out and see if there are modifications that you might want me to make. There is no need to print this at more than 20% infill, but it is up to the user.
Check it out on youtube at: https://youtu.be/gfmk8LB5wUM
Make sure to subscribe for updates and other things that I am printing.
Updates:
I uploaded a V5. What this did is increase the size of the holes and increase the amount of capture the frame would see. Original worked fine but I do like to make improvements. I also included a link to a video of the block being used.

Summary
This project began when my son chose to investigate block and tackle for his 1st grade science fair project.  I was going to zip down to the local Home Depot and buy the supplies, but then thought, â€œI should just print em!â€.  I iterated the design a couple of times before I printed the first full assembly.  Then printed 3 more full assemblies.  Works great!  You will see that there are two types of sheaves, a single and double.  The double actually should have been two separate thin sheaves next to each other within the pulley plates.  The rope had very little friction, so I don't think much advantage was lost.  Wooden dowels (1/4â€) were used to hold the hooks, eyes and sheaves between the side plates.  You can decide whether to use a hook or eye on each end.  
Instructions
Print the parts and assemble according to the drawing.  Light filing/sanding will be required to optimize the fit of the dowels.  Initially, I didn't use the #2 wood screws, the assembly snapped together.  Later, I added the wood screws.  Pre-drill the ends of the wooden dowels and don't stab the sh*t out of your finger (like I did) when you screw in the fasteners.  Refer to the pictures, route rope, lift something!  I used 1/8â€ diameter nylon rope.

Summary
Penguin Peril is a fun game for all ages which can be played with a large group of people. The game consists of a frozen ice lake on which a perilous penguin sits. Players take turns to remove an ice block from the lake until the penguin falls. 
Set-Up:
Place the ice blocks into the ice lake and place the penguin in the middle of the lake. It is easier to reset the ice blocks with the frame turned upside down. 
Gameplay:
Using the hammer, each player takes turns knocking out one ice block from the frozen lake. Once a block has been hit by a player they cannot switch to a different ice block and must continue to hit the same block until it falls through the lake. 
Rules:
The youngest person goes first, then play moves clockwise. The Penguin cannot be touched or moved if it tips over during the game, play the penguin as it lies until it completely falls through the lake. Each player must remove one ice block to end their turn, this can result in multiple ice blocks falling through the lake.
Winner/Loser:
The player who makes the Penguin fall through the lake loses the game, all other player/s are joint winners.

The Ice Blocks have been designed to print with 2 shells using a 0.4mm nozzle with an extrusion width of 0.48mm
If your ice blocks are not gripping properly, do not scale the file, instead increase your extrusion multiplier (flow) by 5% - For PLA I used 0.95 or 95% which delivered good results.
Ice Block Tolerance:
Print 1 Ice Block and measure with calipers, a good tolerance for the game is between 26.0mm - 26.3mm on all sides
Post-Printing
Polysher Tips
ICE BLOCKS
Print the Polyshing plate in PLA and place 13 Ice Blocks printed in PolySmooth™ on the plate. 
Load the plate into the Polysher and set the timer for 15 minutes. 
As soon as the polyshing cycle is finished place the plate with the ice blocks in front of a fan for best results. 
PENGUIN
Use a fine paint brush and some IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol) to join the Breast, Beak & Feet to the Penguin Body. Paint on a coat of IPA in the area where you will bond the pieces and let it soak in for 1 minute. Then join the pieces together and the IPA will chemically bond the PolySmooth™. After bonding let the penguin sit for 10 minutes before loading into the Polysher for a final spin. 
Run a 25-minute cycle to completely smooth the penguin and fully bond all pieces together. After polyshing immediately place the penguin in front of a fan.

Hello everybody!
I had bought a professional knife set at the last Black Friday sale on Amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZCKIBM/ref=cm_sw_su_dp
the knive set didn’t come with a block, so I created one.
SAFETY FIRST!
I will speak about safety because this thing will be at home and knives may be dangerous, so I hope you follow the three important steps below:
1) Use magnets as described on the project, you can find them here:
https://www.amazon.it/Magnetastico%C2%AE-neodimio-frigorifero-permanente-interattiva/dp/B00Z7YVU8A
2) Use rubber pads; print them with TPU95 or another rubber filament
3) Create the ballast with the milling machine - the one in my project has a weight of 2.3Kg
You need this hardware:
Phillips flat head self tapping screw 4.8mm x 22mm: 2pcs
Phillips flat head self tapping screw 5.5mm x 25mm: 2pcs
Neodymium magnets 8mm x 3mm: 4 pcs
Check everything else on the PDF and pics.

-- IMPORTANT --Il s'agit là d'un outil de sécurité. Je ne suis pas ingénieur, mais un simple utilisateur d'imprimante 3D et à ce titre, si vous deviez vous blesser à cause du Push Block Light, ni moi ni Thingiverse ne pourrions être responsable. Si vous décidez d'imprimer le Push Block,Light vous prenez seul la responsabilité de l'utiliser à vos risques et périls.
Lorsque l'on souhaite juste pousser un bout de bois pour faire une découpe rapide, ma version réglable du Push Block (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2056511) n'est pas l'outil le plus rapide à utiliser.
Avec cette version light, aucun réglage n'est possible, mais elle suffit à faire le travail.
Il y a deux poignées de disponible : une en 20mm de large et la deuxième en 25mm de large. Vous pouvez choisir celle qui vous convient le mieux.
Les vis qui retiennent les crochets à l'arrière afin qu'ils puissent rester en place lorsque l'on manipule le Push Block Light, sont en Ø4 mm pour 30 mm de long. Le trou fait Ø3.5 mm et de cette façon, vous pouvez soit utiliser un taraud de Ø4 mm pour créer un pas de vis comme je l'ai fais, soit utiliser une vis de Ø3 mm avec un écrou. Dans tous les cas, ne visser pas trop fort, la pièce doit pouvoir coulisser, cette vis ne suffit aucun effort.
Pour la poignée vous devez utiliser un écrou M5 et un boulon M5 de 30mm.La poignée peut être tournée suivant un angle de 15°
Comme avec la version réglable, pour le revêtement anti-adhérant j'ai utilisé la même plaque de caoutchouc : http://www.leroymerlin.fr/v3/p/produits/plaque-en-caoutchouc-290-x-210-mm-e1400037406?queryredirect=a_fp_plaque_en_caoutchouc__290_x_210_mm&numpage=1
J'espère que vous aimerez cette version light.
Si cet objet vous plait, vous pouvez me payer une bière ou un café (tip designer). Merci ;)
English version
(sorry for my poor English)
-- WARNING --It is security tool. I am not an engineer, but a simple user of 3D printer and for this reason, if you injury you because of Push Block Light, neither me nor Thingiverse let us can be responsible. If you decide to print the Push Block Light, you take the responsibility to use it at your risks.
When you just want to push a piece of wood to make a quick cut, my adjustable version of the Push Block (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2056511) is not the fastest tool to use .
With this light version, no adjustment is possible, but it is enough to do the work.
There are two handles available: one in 20 mm wide and the second in 25 mm wide. You can choose the one that suits you best.
The screws that hold the hooks at the back so they can stay in place when handling the Push Block Light, are Ø4 mm for 30 mm long. The hole is Ø3.5 mm and this way you can either use a tap of Ø4 mm to create a screw thread as I did, or use a screw of Ø3 mm with a nut. In any case, do not screw too hard, the part must be able to slide, this screw is not enough effort.
For the handle you must use an M5 nut and an M5 bolt of 30 mm. The handle can be rotated at an angle of 15 °
Like with the adjustable version, for the non-skid coating I used the same rubber plate: http://www.leroymerlin.fr/v3/p/produits/plaque-en-caoutchouc-290-x-210-mm-e1400037406?queryredirect=a_fp_plaque_en_caoutchouc__290_x_210_mm&numpage=1
I hope you enjoy this light version.
If you like this item, you can buy me a beer or a coffee (tip designer). Thank you ;)

Found this model and saw that some people were requesting a V8 Engine Block.  I found this one online and cut the bottom flat so it should print without support of any kind.
The front of this engine block is same as the rear.  I guess whoever modeled it didn't know the back of an engine block is different.
Instructions
Just scale it and print it.  You shouldn't need any support.  I'm in the process of printing it myself and will post my results when I'm finished.
Also if anyone can tell me what exactly this engine block is from I would like to update the info about it.

Summary
This Customizable Brick Block Box is based on the brick blocks from the original Super Mario Bros.
Thanks to the flexibility of OpenSCAD, this can be turned into a solid block, a cup, a container with a lid, or a tube with an open top and bottom - but with just a little scripting, it can be customized into many other remix projects!
https://youtu.be/XsQWnMtSShM
https://youtu.be/XsQWnMtSShM
Customization Options
Customization goes far beyond mere scaling.
You can set:
Width/depth of the block
Number of brick layers
Size of the chamfer between each brick
Object style (solid, tube, cup, lid)
Wall width
Brick pattern (same as rotating the object 90 degrees, but may be relevant in future updates)
Clearance
Enable/disable top layer brick pattern
Enable/disable bottom layer brick pattern
Printing
If your printer can print 45 degree overhangs, this can be printed without supports.
By default, the block has a smooth bottom. While it can be printed with a brick texture on the bottom, you must have very good print bed adhesion for this to look good. curling on the bottom layer can be an issue.
Updates
July 19th, 2021
A new option has been added to mimic modern style ""3D Mario"" blocks. This is currently the default option. Idea and updated script provided by Joeri Noort.
July 21st, 2021

Summary
An anchor bracket for the top corner of a brick or concrete block, which can be used at both ends of a block wall to ensure it's level. 
Simply run a builder's line or string between the two end brackets, once the end blocks have been placed in mortar, and all your other blocks in between can be aligned to the string.
You'll need to print two brackets, and mirror one of them so you have opposite left and right corners. No print supports are required.

Printing a cube is a good way to begin calibrating your machine, but it only gives you so much information. This is a slightly more advanced test that allows you to confirm your machine scale is properly calibrated by measuring 3 different lengths in each axis. 
You can confirm that the narrow leg is 10mm, the middle cube is 20mm and the long length is 40mm along each axis. If it is over, but it is off by about the same amount at each measurement point (say 11, 21 and 41mm), then you are seeing the results of material expansion or another problem. If it is off by a relative amount (say 11, 22 and 44mm), you know your scale settings are wrong for that axis.

Summary
Spring is in the air, so its time to plant some seeds and grow some veggies!
Soils blocks are an excellent way to sow seeds indoors or in the greenhouse to prepare for planting outside. You don't need a lot of plastic pots, can quickly plant a lot of seeds, and most importantly, plants in soil blocks don't get root bound like they do in pots, so get less transplant shock once you plant them in the garden.

This set contains three different size blockers:
Large 5x5x6 cm soil blocks with a dimple on top for the seeds
Small 3.5x3.5x4 cm soil blocks for smaller seeds.
Micro 1.8cm soil blocks for germinating seeds indoors that will be planted out directly into the garden or transplant into the large soilblocker (use the square nub)
Separate requested designs with special dimensions:
XL 6.5x6.5cm soil block maker for extra large blocks
1x4 Large block maker for bulk making blocks

How to make a soil block:
Make a fine potting soil in a bucket. You can mix your own but potting mix works fine. make sure there are no big pieces of wood or fiber; you could print a sieve if needed.
Water the soil thoroughly. The soil needs to be really wet but not muddy. If you can make a ball in your hand that keeps it shape, and if you can squeeze water out the ball with your fist it's wet enough.
Fill the blocker by pressing it into the soil, or fill with your hands until it is completely full.
Put the blocker in a shallow tray, press the plunger to compress the soil a bit extra, then raise the mantle while keeping light pressure on the plunger.
You now have a soil block! Seed it, lightly cover the hole with some extra soil if needed. The block needs to be watered after about two days.

Summary
Hocus Pocus! You present your audience with six colored blocks, each one with a hole through its face.  Your audience inspects the blocks as well as the box you will place them in and the pin you will pierce them with.  A volunteer selects two of the six blocks.  After placing all six blocks into the box,  you pierce the box and all the blocks with a pin.  Waving your hand over the box, you say a magic word.  Turning the box upside down, the lid falls off and out drops the two chosen blocks!  But wait the pin is still running through the box with the remaining blocks still pinned in place!
See the demo video http://youtu.be/pmZhGH7pSUo
Print this magic trick along with Thing 24719,
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24719
and put on an impromptu magic show!  You'll be sure to amaze your friends and family.
Instructions
Print either the ""small"" or ""large"" version of the trick.  I recommend using the small version as the smaller blocks are less likely to tip over as you load them into the box.  While there's nothing wrong with them tipping over, it is annoying and makes it look like you are fumbling or doing something tricky.  On the other hand, if you want such an effect -- then use the large version! 
The large version uses six 20x20mm blocks while the small version uses six 20x14mm blocks.  Not surprisingly, it will take you less time to print the smaller version.
Small Version
Print pin.stl (same file works for either the small or large version).
Print six copies of small-block.stl.  It looks best if you print each one a different color.
Print the box top and bottom: use either small-box.stl or the individual small-lid.stl and small-bottom.stl files.  If you have problems with the print curling at the edges, then you may be better off printing the two pieces separately as that will have them closer to the center of your build platform.
You can use the magic-blocks.scad file to tweak any of the parts to your liking.
Large Version
Print pin.stl.
Print six copies of larger-block.stl.  The trick looks best if you print each one a different color.
Print the box top and bottom: use either large-box.stl or the individual large-lid.stl and large-bottom.stl files.  If you have problems with the print curling at the edges, then you may be better off printing the two pieces separately as that will have them closer to the center of your build platform.
You can use the magic-blocks.scad file to tweak any of the parts to your liking.
Performing the Trick
To perform the trick,
Start with the blocks in the box with the pin running through them.  Show the audience how the pin traps the blocks in place, preventing their removal.
Remove the pin and dump the blocks out.  Allow the audience to inspect the blocks, box and pin.
Choose a volunteer from the audience to select two of the six blocks.
Using the lid to obscure the audience's view, return all six of the blocks to the box.  However, place the two selected blocks in at 90 degrees from the other blocks:
| | |===| | |
| | |===| | |
     ^^^ Two selected blocks
 ^^^      ^^^ Remaining 4 blocks
Close the box with the lid.
Pierce the blocks with the pin,
  | | |===| | |
----------------o  Pin
  | | |===| | |
Show the audience that all the blocks, including the chosen ones, are still in the box by letting them see the blocks through the peep holes in the box's lid and bottom.
Turn the box upside down but holding the lid in place.
Release the lid,  allowing it and the two selected blocks to magically drop out of the box.
Show that the other blocks remain pinned!  Jiggle the box a little if you need to prevent the audience from seeing the large gap left behind by the two selected blocks.  Point being to not have them realize that those two blocks were put in sideways.
Take a bow or begin another trick such as Thing 24719, the magic coin piercing trick which you can also print!

How I Designed This
Summary
Hinged Mount Pulley Block
Designed to take weight by mounting to horizontal or vertical surface.
Tested to hold static 70-80kg (my body weight) but I do not recommend using for heavy weight purposes.
To complete each pulley you will need;
1x 608 Bearing
1x M6 80mm hex head bolt and nut
1x M8 25mm hex head bolt and nut
4x M3 20mm button head bolt and nut
Let me know what you think. I still have a few more to print before completing the project, will upload pics once done.

Notes:
All parts can be printed at once if you have good bed adhesion and time.I have included a pic of the layout i found works best.
Alternatively you can print parts indivudually or in combination as required.
Wheel or Sheave is trickiest as it must be printed vertically with tree supports and a brim of 4 lines.
Other parts have flat bases and will print well enough with no supports or brim.
Post-Printing
608 Bearing should press fit into wheel.
Wheel fits one way over main or base pulley block and top slots into front guid and pulley wheel.
4x 20mm M3 bolt with nuts secure base and top of pulley block together.
1x 25mm M8 hex head bolt with nut screws through pulley wheel and both sides of block.
1x 80mm M6 bolt with nut slides through pulley block and mounting plate to make hinge.
NB: for pulley block fixings. First insert nut into pulley block top then screw bolt through block into nut to secure. M6 is designed for bolt to turn last quarter and 'drop' into smaller hex depression on pulley block main piece.
How I Designed This
While i took inspiration from some amazing designs here on Thingiverse, in the end I designed this from scratch in Fusion360

I also include my original Blender art files if you would like to make further changes or remixes.
Note about screws: I did not put screws with my design since I never saw that on any official Nintendo products or reference. Many people choose to add screws from other files and they work very well.

Summary
Great Christmas decoration... this Santa Hat has been made to fit on top of a bottle of Bubbly or wine to dress it up during the festive season. Will fit on before opening the bottle and can be used as a cover after opening (...but not as a sealing cap).
The design is shaped internally to make the hat sit slightly back when on an open bottle (i.e. there is an angled internal surface to orient it this way)   
Can also be used as a simple decorative piece... easy print. Allowing for a 1mm Raft Base change the colours from white to red at 16mm (approx. 39%) and from red back to at white 73mm (approx. 92%) on a Replicator 2.   
At standard (100%) size the hole in the base will print at approx. 32.5mm  in diameter so it is a loose fit onto any wine bottle and is a snug fit onto a bubbly bottle with it's wire and foil still in place. Could easily  be resized to suit other bottles etc. (eg. beer bottles).  
Note: Two additional .stl files (alt_support and no_support) have been added due to different slicing apps/machines capabilities. The alt_support version is required for some slicing apps that have issues with slicing the original .stl file that has thin/fine designed in support. The thicker support alt_support option helps these slicing apps recognise the support but will mean the print takes slightly longer and more filament is used. The no_support .stl has no designed in support. Using automated support with this option is recommended. 
If you like this check out the rest of my fun and practical designs... and post images of your things in use for others to see!
Tips: Tips are not expected but are appreciated as they help offset my filament costs as much as anything else. However, as I live outside the USA tips cannot be sent to me via PayPal.Me as that service is not supported in my region and this is beyond Thingverse's control. If you feel like sending a tip please use regular PayPal and send it to muzz64nz@gmail.com and, to those who do,  thanks in advance!
Instructions
Use a Raft Base (approx. 1mm) but leave Supports ""OFF"" as the required support for PLA has been designed in. Print at Standard (0.20mm) resolution with 3 shells and 15% fill.
Allowing for the 1mm Raft Base change the colours from white to red at 16mm (approx. 39%) and from red back to at white 73mm (approx. 92%) on a Replicator 2.
The designed in support should come away easily including the internal support designed inside the cap.   
Note: A second .stl (alt_support) has been added which has more solid support. This is required for some slicing apps that have issues with slicing the original files fine designed in support. However, the thicker support will mean the print takes slightly longer and more filament is used.

The Gyroscup
Ever sat on a couch where the couch table was just too far away to conviniently put down your drink? Well here's the over-engineering solution to a problem you probably never really knew about until you read this text. The Gyroscup!
Why?
There are various solutions for self-aligning drink holders out there such as this, this or this. They're all great and serve a much more honorable purpose of helping people that might struggle not to spill their drink because of physical limitations.
But for me, I needed something that I could use to put down my glass of wine on the couch (i.e. with feet) without worrying about making a mess, so here we are. To answer the question of ""why?"": Well, let's be honest. It's simply because I can.
The Gyroscup has an inner diameter of 84mm and a cut-out, so you can also use it for coffee mugs and any other conic types of glasses or cups with a similar diameter. I've included the screws because my local hardware stores were closed down when I designed and printed this. Shout out to nut job, which was super useful. If printing screws seems a little laborious to you, you should also be able to just use regular M6 screws.
Update: If you prefer, you can now print the non-cutout version, as well. The advantage is that the rings should stay horizontal, if no glass is in the Gyroscup. The disadvantages are that you can't use Gyroscup for your mug and that you cant insert a wine glass from the side. It's up to you. It's not necessary to print the outer ring without the cutout if you want to save some filament. I just uploaded it in case someone wants to use it for aesthetic reasons.
What to print
What you need to print (and how many):
Inner.stl or InnerNoCutOut.stl (1)
Middle.stl or MiddleNoCutOut.stl (1)
Outer.stl or OuterNoCutOut.stl (1)
Foot.stl (3)
bolt_6_short.stl (3)
bolt_6_long.stl (4)
nut_6mm.stl (7)
If I remember correctly, I printed everything with a 50% grid infill (except for the screws, where I used a 100% infill).
Assembly
Prettey straight forward. Connect the three rings with two long bolts each. You'll see which way around the screws go because they are countersunk. Next slide on the three feet where there are still unused holes left and connect them with the short bolts.
All of this should work out without the need for support, any extra parts or post-print work.
Enjoy your perfectly aligned glass of wine!

This solved my problem of my wine glasses being too tall for the top rack. Clip these onto the stem and then slide them onto your lower level dish rack uprights. It's super stable and has been through a number of cycles so far, still working great.ABS probably works best for the heat in the dishwasher...  
V2 Added - put a wedge in the corner for extra strength - also added a single holder version as requested.  
V3 - Made the uprights 2mm thicker for more strength

My own design of a wine aerator to insert into a wine bottle with non dripping top.  
This is a work in progress and i would like to get some feedback from you so i can improve it.  
The prototype i have printed is in ABS plastic 1.75mm
And the gasket is printed in Ninja Flex 1.75mm
The aerator fitts al wine bottles with an opening betwin Ø17-21mm   
If you dont have Ninjaflex
Try with O-Rings as gasket or maby a rubber band will work if you cut and glue them as O-Rings  
Updates:
The new wine aerator have a better venturi function and a bigger air ventilation hole to increse the flowrate of the wine coming out of the bottle.
Instructions
Model is made in Autocad 2014  
After some trail and errors i finaly have a working aerator working as i want it to.
I printed it with the top dripp free zoone down to the bed with support on 35° and 5mm brim
I found this was the best way to get it as smooth as bossible and to stick enogh to the bed so it wont fall down.

This is a wine glass holder with a strap to go around your neck. This can be very convenient at wine festivals and wine tastings. It leaves two hands free to reach into your purse two pay for that great bottle of wine you tasted (or to grab more munchies).
Instructions
print one ""wine_holder_base_111115b.stl"".
print two ""wine_link_111115a_ctr.stl"" links.
snap together so that the curved side of the link faces the wine glass.
The last image shows how to attach the neck strap to the links.
A thicker ribbed webbing works better than a thin ribbon. For a wider ribbon fold it in half lengthwise so it fits in the slot. Melting the ends of the ribbon will keep it from fraying. Pull test it a bit to make sure that the strap will not pull out.

These work well with the 28mm Bar Back too http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1477280

Summary
Project Modular Wine Rack is my attempt to design a 3d printed piece-together wine shelving for our pantry space in our home. Currently we're stacking bottles together and it's not pretty. Most wine rack furniture turns me off. This design is a single gear which can be stacked together and store as many or as little bottles as needed.   
This is a work in progress as an additional part is needed that will close the gaps and securely lock the ""gears"" together. I don't think the parts can be stacked as-is and support a lot of weight without wanting to roll away from each other. I printed some 1:5 scale model pieces and they seemed to work ok.   
Ultimately I chose not to print a bunch of these out due to the material cost (currently an issue I have being a Cubify user), and the time needed. Someday I'll get around to it. In the meantime hopefully this design will inspire other 3d printed wine racks :) Enjoy!

How I Designed This
Summary
Become a barrel maker! Print and assemble this cute wine barrel flower pot. 
The wine barrel flower pot makes a perfect gift. 
The wine barrel flower pot really consists of 19 single planks which give the barrel a realistic look. The barrel is 13.0 cm (5.12 inches) high and 9.7 cm (3.82 inches) wide. The inner pot has an inner diameter of 6.8 cm (2.68 inches) and an inner heigth of 11.5 cm (4.53 inches).
Please do not resize the model in your slicer, as the tolerances are designed for the present size.  
The wine barrel flower pot is basically my object ""The wine barrel box"" plus an inner pot to hold the soil. The inner pot should be printed in PETG to make it resistant against the humid soil. 
If you need another wine barrel without the flower pot functionality, you might consider my following Thingiverse objects:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5390822
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5396937
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5428998
List of items to print:
Barrel flower pot segment V1.stl
Print this item 19 times.
Barrel flower pot cover bottom V1.stl
Print this item once.
Barrel flower pot cover top V1.stl
Print this item once.
Barrel flower pot ring large V1.stl
Print this item once.
Barrel flower pot ring small V1.stl
Print this item twice.
Barrel flower pot inner pot V1.stl
Print this item once.
Barrel flower pot segment+1mm V1.stl
Barrel flower pot segment-1mm V1.stl
Use these segments as a substitution for one or more normal segments, if the segments do not form the 360 degrees angle at the end. Example: If there is a 2 mm gap, exchange 2 normal segments against 2 segments which are 1 mm wider each.
You may want to print the following items in a brown color to simulate wood:
Barrel flower pot segment V1.stl, Barrel flower pot cover bottom V1.stl, Barrel flower pot cover top V1.stl.
When the following items are printed in a silver color, they look like metal:
Barrel flower pot ring small V1.stl, Barrel flower pot ring large V1.stl.
Print the following item in PETG so that it can withstand the humidity of the soil:
Barrel flower pot inner pot V1.stl
The assembly is easier than the assembly of my other barrels. You will need a rubber band to avoid frustration. Please look at the assembly instructions further down. No glue is needed, everything comes together nicely. 
Enjoy printing this object. So many likes and downloads of this object. Thank you very much.
2022-08-01 New segments
Added STLs Barrel flower pot segment+1mm V1.stl and Barrel flower pot segment-1mm V1.stl. If the segments do not form the 360 degrees, substitute one or more normal sized segments with the 1 mm wider or 1 mm less wide segments.

If you use the Cura slicer you can use the experimentatl feature ""Use Adaptive Layers"" to save some print time for the 19 segments. I got very good results with the adaptive layers.
Do not resize the barrel in your slicer program. Everything is designed for the existing size. If you resize it, I am not sure if the segments will form the required 360 ° angle.

Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 1
Try to create a structure as shown in the picture. Hold it with your fingers.
Please ensure the correct orientation of the round bottom cover. The outer slope of of the bottom cover follows the outer segment. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 2
Add the upper inner ring to the structure. It will give it a bit more stability at this moment. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 3
Add a rubber band to hold the structure together. The rubber band should sit in the middle outer inset. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 4
Add more segments to the 4 existing segments. Try to hold the existing four segments with your fingers to prevent them from moving. This is the difficult part. The more segments you add the more stable the barrel will get. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 5
When you have added all 19 segments, the barrel should look like shown in the picture. The rubber band still holds everything together. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 6
Insert the top and bottom rings. Please make sure that the rings are facing in the correct direction. The upper part of the upper ring is a bit less wide than the lower part of the upper ring. With the lower ring it is just opposite. Once you have one ring in place the barrel is stable and cannot fall apart any longer. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 7
Add the middle ring. 
Wine barrel flower pot assembly part 8
Slide in the inner pot which holds the soil.
The assembly is now complete and you have created a very cute wine barrel flower pot. 
How I Designed This
The wine barrel flower pot was designed with Blender.

Summary
This is a configurable Bottle Rack for the use in refrigerators. It allows bottles to be stored lying down without them rolling around (as can happen in fridges without a lie down bottle rack). Some fridges come with a full width bottle rack which wastes space if it's not always full. This rack system lets you use only the space required to accommodate your usual refrigerated bottle storage needs. 
The parts are all small enough to be printed on almost any machine so you can print just what you need... and add on as required. 
Two rack files have been provided. The 'slim' version is made to accommodate smaller volume beer bottles and soft drinks (of up to 65mm diameter)and the standard version will accommodate larger bottles (up to 87.5mm) including common still and sparkling wine bottles. The joining link is common which allows the rack to be configured to refrigerate the size/range of bottles to suit individual habits. 
Please note the joining link must be inserted completely onto one Rack with the outsets/insets aligned before inserting the second Rack and snapping it together. This will make it easier to join and also reduce the likelihood of any damage to the parts.     
This is a practical storage solution that saves space because it doesn't need to span the full width of your refrigerator. Great to use for yourself at home or also use as a unique and practical gift. 
Please refer to the images and print settings for additional information... and post images of your bottles in storage for other member to see,.

Post-Printing
Configure your rack...
Link the parts together as shown in the images. As long as the prints are accurate and strong it's easy!

Has been printed ""tall"" by MakerBot Replicator 2 use PLA material, layer high 0.25mm 50%infill took 16 hrs.
It works very well.
--
When you going to print this, layer high 0.15~0.25mm should be fine raft is better to use and best to use over 50% infill.
Hope you will like it ;)   
Enjoy ;)

Go here for the Customizer version.  
A photo of me with each pixel rendered as a different size diamond corresponding to brightness. The pixels are connected in columns like beads on a string.  
The model is generated with a Customizer script which will allow you to upload your own images and tweak the pixel bead style a bit. However, as written, the design is very slow to compile and the results are kind of tricky to slice and print. I'd like to be able to recommend reliable settings for easy printing, so I think I'll refrain from publishing the customizer until I can figure out some fixes.

For tips on printing glider wings, drop by my blog at threedsy.com and if you like our models, keep us designing for you instead of flipping burgers by purchasing one of our premium designs from the site!  
Instructions
Protips: 
Your printer will need to be capable of printing smooth 1 and 2 layer prints. Adjust your first layer settings to achieve solid layers with no surface debris or curling.
If you have trouble with prints lifting, try the ""beard"" versions. trim off the ""beard"" when done.
Layer height matters, as does fill ratio. Increasing the fill ratio for the fuselage will shift the CG. I am using .20 layer height - you will want to be as close to this as possible. 
If thinner layers are desired, use a factor of .2mm .  My nozzle is .35mm, but a .5 should work fine. If your nozzle is smaller than .33, adjust the perimeters accordingly.
The wing is printed with an axis - orthogonal fill orientation to minimize warping and maximize durability. The first layer should run lengthwise, the second spanwise. 
The wing must be very flat. Use care when removing the wing and tail sections from the bed. Peel up from the tips toward the fuselage with a thin blade or spatula, lifting only as much as possible to break free, being careful not to disturb the spanwise symmetry. If the wings are not perfectly symetrical when viewed from the front of the aircraft, adjustments will be required for proper performance.
Glue the tail and canopy / hook into place with a tiny drop of superglue.
Known working instructions:
Print the Stratos using ABS. .20 layer height (or close) , 2 perimeters, and 2 solid layers, 20% line fill. Use a fill orientation of 0 degrees to the axis of the fuselage (natural axis of the print), so that the first layer runs forward and aft.
Print the launcher with 3 perimeters (2 for .5 nozzle), 2 solid layers, and .35 line fill. Two perimeters are not enough, and will break. Scale the part to your preference - it is not layer critical.
Glue the tail and canopy / hook into place with a tiny amount of superglue.
Carefully bow the wings upward to give a slight rounded dihedral. 
Add a tiny bit of up elevator until the plane flies straight and level.
left to its own devices, the plane will want to dive sharply under and fly upside down. A small up elevator adjustment will correct this tendency.
Put on a nice stretchy (18-24"" extended) rubber band on the launcher, and fly!
Flight tips:
As designed, the plane has nearly neutral stability, and can be trimmed to fly right side up or upside down if only a very small amount of up elevator is dialed in. 
If adjusted in this way it is possible to perform a half loop terminating in an slow, extended inverted glide, usually rolling to right side up due to the dihedral. If you can get it tuned for this, you can get some very long flights this way!
A small amount of weight (3mm washer, etc) can be glued to the fuselage forward of the hook for more stability or longer flights. 
For thermalling, keep it as light as possible. Adjust for circling flight of 50 - 75 foot radius. Trim for slowest possible flight without stalling, then in 30 - 45 minutes the control surfaces will have relaxed to close to being correct. Make tiny adjustments until maximum flight duration (not distance) is achieved. You will need a strong thermal (or micro-thermal) to gain altitude, as this is a tiny model, with a short wingspan. I have had some luck in parking lots and ridge lift situations. 
Protip by Apexio (from comments below) : ""Managed to thermal one a few times yesterday...    Adding under camber and a good amount of dihedral to the wing makes a night and day difference in flight performance. ""
Except in extreme cases, do not bend ailerons in the wing. Use the elevators as elevons instead. Using the rudder will cause side-slip drag, and will result in shorter flights. If the model seems to be skidding, use the rudder to align the fuselage to the direction of flight, then elevon tweaking to get straight and level or any other desired flight profile.
A neat trick is to adjust the pane for straight looping flight, then launch at about a 30 degree roll angle, slightly upward. Keep adjusting launch and control profiles until the plane circles around so that you can catch it.
The plane can be scaled to 66% and printed at .15, or 150% at .30 with reasonable results. The 150% will require additional weight at the nose.
Other materials and layer heights may work as well, please post your results!
Update : 
Prints fine with PLA. Extra care needed during removal. Nominally heavier. Works but is less durable and harder to glue - not recommended if you can use ABS.
Added ""bearded"" versions to facilitate printing in Polycarbonate, Nylon, or ABS on unheated beds. Please leave feedback on how this works!

A bread lame is a knife/razor used for scoring loaves, baguettes etc. before baking in the oven.
No support required.
http://www.gyrobot.co.uk
http://www.facebook.com/gyrobotuk
Instructions
Print the body, safety guard and handle of your choice, all without support.
Use high infill in the body for extra strength.
Tip: The handle has an octagonal hole for the body, rotate the part or the infill angle so that roof layer of this hole is printed across the handle to  easily bridge the gap.  
There is the ""Gyrobot's Lame"" ;-) handle but I have included a handle without a logo.  
To assemble:
Depending on your printer calibration, you may need to glue the body into the handle (or shave it down if it's too big). The body has a small split line for compression which should help it's insertion into the handle.  
The razor blade can be attached in two ways depending on your preference for a curved or straighter blade, please images for this. You curve the blade by squeezing the ends gently and with care.  
The safety guard will slide using the natural spring of the blade inside to aid smoothness, it should click home when fully attached.  
Please be responsible with this device, razor blades are extremely sharp!!  
All lame jokes welcome.

These are the printable versions of the original wicker baskets for bread proofing.   
The uploaded models are 4 different shapes commonly used for baking the country style or European style bread which has the signature ring pattern on its surface.  These proofing baskets really give your homemade bread an even more professional looking finish!   
Instructions
Dimensions:  X,Y,Z  mm  
Round:            170 x 170 x 66
Oval:               118 x 180 x 62
Triangle:         164 x 177 x 69
Hemisphere:   184 x 184 x 70  
Print with the filament you trust.  
Store the baskets in a dry and well-ventilated area.  
The higher the printing resolution the better.
It will help with the curved surfaces especially the top part of the bottom loops. If you want high res but don't want them to take too long to print, you can set up the variable layer height with Slic3r so only the top part of the bottom loops are printed in higher res.  
The surface layer lines of the plastic printed ones look very much like the ones made with dried vine.   As you can see from the pictures above, the baskets do give the proofed bread a very nice and visible pattern on the surface.     However, the plastic ones are not as porous and are easier for moisture to collect on the surface.   Be sure to keep them dry.  
You can scale the baskets up or down to fit your preferred dimensions.  
Heavily dust the baskets with flour before putting in the dough to prevent from sticking and to help with making the pattern.  If you want even more obvious looking patterns, grab a handful of dry flour and smudge it over the shaped dough before you putting it in the baskets.  Put the tight surface of your worked dough facing down.   
To clean the baskets just use brushes to brush off the excess flour.  Clean them with water ( not hot ) and soap only when they are getting gunky.  Dry them well as soon as possible and store them in a well-ventilated area.  
Happy baking!

Summary
This is a bread slicer that can be collapsed into 4 pieces to minimize the required storage space. The slicer supports loafs baked in a 5"" x 9"" bread pan and knives that are up to 2mm thick. The source code for this design is provided so that it can be modified to support other bread and knife sizes.
You will need to print (1) base, (1) slide, and (2) guides.
To assemble:
Stand a guide upright
Inserts the base onto the guide pegs
Stand the second guide upright
Insert the other side of the base on to the second guide pegs
Insert the stopper into the last knife slits of each guide
To use:
Insert a loaf of bread onto the base
Slide the loaf of bread until it reaches the stopper
Hold the loaf of bread against the stopper
Insert a bread knife into the slits in the guide opposite the stopper
Saw the bread until the knife reaches the base and the slice falls over
Remove the knife
Repeat steps 4-6 until the entire loaf is sliced
WARNING: Be careful not to cut yourself when cutting the last few slices of a loaf.
Change log:
(v1.1) The guide pegs have been tweaked to allow the pieces to lock together for easier storage. The other parts are backwards compatible, so you just need to print 2 new guides to upgrade.

Notes:
The large flat surfaces that make contact with the print bed may be difficult to remove depending on the material. When using PLA, consider using a glue stick or a raft to avoid print bed damage during removal.
A tolerance of 0.15mm is used for the interlocking pieces. This should create a tight fit, but may need to be increased to 0.2-0.3mm on printers with lower dimensional accuracy.

Modified version for deeper cuts: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4351888 
I bake a lot of sourdough breads both inside and in a wood fired oven. For years i have just been using a razor blade held by hand to score my loafs. I never liked or had much success with commercial designed bread lames (long spike with blade bent on end). So i finally decided to design a small housing that will proved the flexibility and ease of use i needed.
It takes a standard shaving razor blade and encases it. You can either glue two half's together or use a few m3 bolts to secure. Comes with a very simple safety cover.
Hope you enjoy it.

Summary
This is a bread lame used to score bread before baking it. I made it as a gift my uncle who is a baker. I can’t guarantee that it will work, but at least it looks nice.
It should fit most double edged razor blades. There are two pyramids on the tip that will hold the blade in place and because of the curve on it, the blade will hold everything in place like a spring. There are also two indentations on the knob that will click onto the pyramids for alignment. The tip will flex a bit when installing the blade but that should be fine. 
Edited to add a fused pun and knob model called “combined_lock_lame.stl” for anyone who prefers to print these together using more supports. I have not tested this file so it may not work.

Notes:
The only part that needs supports is the knob. All the parts should already be oriented the correct way for printing.
The tolerance between the pin and the hole it goes through is very tight, so you might need to file down the hole a little bit so it works smoothly.
Use some CA glue (superglue) to attach the pin to the knob at a 90º angle and the tip to the handle.

Store-bought bread usually comes sliced already or the store can slice it for you.  We have been making our own bread almost every other day for quite a while now and we've been wanting to slice our bread more evenly so it fits the toaster better and looks nicer as well.   This thing helps us do exactly that.
.
This fully-printable slicing guide can be adjusted to hold different loaf sizes (between 110mm~160mm width).  Each slice is about 14mm thick or you can double that for Texas Toast.
.
Enjoy!  
Instructions
Dimensions of parts:
.
(X,Y,Z) (mm)
.
Base:   =109, 180, 12
Guide: =128, 165, 30
Nut:  11.2, 11.2, 5.5
Bolt: 7.4, 7.4, 100
.  
Printing:
.
Base: L+R  one each / any layer height
Guide: L+R  one each / any layer height
Nuts:  4 on one side, 8 for both sides / at least 0.15mm layer height
Bolts: one for each side, 2 for both/ at least 0.15mm layer height
.
Using only one set of fasteners ( 4 nuts+ 1 bolt ) on only one side of the base is usually good enough to hold the parts, but fastening both sides will of course make it extra secure.
.
Print the nuts and bolts separately to minimize crossing of the perimeters.    If you are getting a lot of oozing from crossing perimeters, try slicing the nuts with Slic3r v.0.910b. From my experiments only this version will not move the oozing nozzles across the perimeters when printing the nuts.      Newer versions will make the crossing and leave unwanted ooze and messy surfaces for the nut threads.
.
There are click snaps at the end of the base slots, be careful not to break the flaps when you push the slicing guides into the base slots.  If you are having a hard time making the click snap, sanding or filing the contact area just a little bit will help a lot.
.
All the fitting parts have tolerance value on them,  so they should fit nicely unless your printer is really off.  If that is the case, I usually recommend running the part fitting calibration ( thing:342198 ). It is a good idea to print the nuts and bolts first to ensure a good fitting before printing the bigger parts.
.  
Using:
.
Adjust the slicing guides and fasten the nuts to hold the bread steady. Hold down the bread when slicing for extra support.

Hi-
I designed this little thing for a project at Kishwaukee College. It's a simple, very useful bag clip. To use, just fold over the open top of your bag a couple of times and simply slip this clip over the folded edge.
This little gadget is as simple as it gets, but I find it to be very useful. I've printed and handed out dozens of these here using our uPrint SE+, and haven't recevied any complaints about it.
I'm providing an stl and a sldprt file for Solidworks if you'd like to modify the part at all.
Please let me know if you print one of these and try it out this by sending me an email at paulbelcher@gmail.com - I'd really like to hear from unbiased people about how you find the product works for you.
Thank you!
Paul
Instructions
Fold over, or twist shut the open part of a bag you'd like to be held closed, and simply slip the clip onto the bag to hold it closed. Couldn't be more simple.

Summary
All too often toast can be difficult to remove from a toaster (even with a lift mechanism to raise the height  of the toast) dues to the height/shape of the bread toasted. To get the toast out people have been known to try all sorts of things that can result in burns or, even worse, an electric shock.  
You can buy wooden tongs to do a similar thing but they go down the sides of the toast so can get very close to or damage the toaster elements. Because they are made of wood, over time they can also get burnt from the hot metal surfaces, albeit better than your fingers getting burnt. And, they are quite expensive for what they are,   
The design incorporates a rotating joint so the arms can swing in/out to suit the width of the piece of toast. This could have been made to spring open, so force required to narrow them, but that meant additional pressure would be required to securely grab the toast not to mention a loss of feel. The Toast Extractor is not springy so it needs very little pressure to pinch onto the toast and lift it out.   
This is a one piece print with independently moving parts. No support required. With a well set up / accurate machine you should only have to give the joint a gentle 'wiggle' after printing for it to come free and start rotating easily.   
Refer to images and print instructions for more information.   
Note: If you like this check out all my other designs!   
The 'Toast Extractor' is your solution...  
Rather than being inserted into the toaster between the toast and elements the 'Toast Extractor' grabs the sides of the toast. The arms of the 'Toast Extractor' don't go into the element area or touch the metal parts at all. They just let you grab the toast... think of them as finger extensions.  
Instructions
The 'Toast Extractor' needs to be strong to be durable and grab the toast securely. On a Replicator 2 (other machines should be similar) print as follows:  
Use Raft
0.20mm / Std. Resolution
4 Shells (Minimum)
60% infill (or more)
No support required  
Note: Do not rescale or the joint may not function correctly. The joint has been designed to fairly close tolerances so it will move freely/smoothly without being excessively loose. You may need to wiggle the two parts slightly after printing to get the two parts moving independently.

This is a easy-to-print bag clip, that you can pop right off the build plate and use for all of your bag-sealing needs!
The springiness means it also doubles as a satisfying finger-pinching fidget toy,
It uses a print-in-place spring, and the unique design allows it to be printed without supports of any kind! I like to print it scaled up a bit (around 150%)
Works great in PLA, PLA+, PETG, ABS, and more.
No supports needed, but turn on bridge settings
Standard layer height, walls, and infill should work fine
If the parts are sticking together try printing the Looser Tolerance version.

Summary
Rectangular bread lame, using standard double edge razor blade and no extra hardware parts.
This design allows the blade to be safely stored, and allows two different exposed blade lengths.
The holder is roughly 45mm x 30mm x 7mm, and is easily holdable.
Ideally printed using 0.1mm layer thickness to allow for better grippage of the blade.  Depending on your printer, you may need to clean up some edges; you want a loose fit to the two halves.

One of the fascinating things with 3D printers is the ability to print mechanical objects. To catch some mice, I've designed a mouse friendly mousetrap. The trap is fully printable and you don't need any screws or other hardware. Everything is press fit or screwable. Just add some peanut butter bread or other bait and you're good to go!  
One thing I hated from existing mousetrap designs is the inability to easily add bait to the trap. So I made an easy sliding lock door with a hook for the bate.  
It took my quite some time designing this thing. So if you print one yourself, please share a pic. I always like to see things I designed used by others and it encourages me to share more 3D designs.  
Printed with 0,25mm layer height on a Felix 1.5 3D printer with 0,15 infill. Used 140 gram PLA.
Instructions
Print every part, and press or screw together. See exploded view for assembly instructions.
Almost everything is printable without support material, only part mousetrap [Top-door] [V2].stl needs a tiny bit of support otherwise the hinges are floating.
The size is 20 x 70 x 71, if it doesn't fit on your print bed, try to fit it diagonally. Otherwise you can shrink the complete design. I've printed one at 80% size and it's fully functional, but I don't think you should go smaller. The bigger it is, the more comfortable the mouse will go in.

A simple charging stand that fits the magnetic charger and neatly tucks the USB cable out of the way. There is a pocket at the base if you wish to weigh it down with some lead shot or attach a magnet. 
Update 5/9/21:
Added a version with wider cutouts for the USB A plug pass through. That should give a bit more wiggle room to get the plug through. 
Instructions
I printed this on its side, with supports, with 300 micron layers. It turned out well. Supports are optional, most people have had excellent results without supports.

[updated February 5, 2016: should be easier to print. Removed the feet from the insert, thickened the bezel and other sections. Removed some overhangs. Opened up the slot at the top.]
This is a two-part charging dock for the Apple Watch.
Part 1 (stand) holds the wireless charging puck in place. Part 2 (shell) slides on top, and provides a place to set your Apple Watch. Slots in the sides of the shell hold the watch steady by its band, while the magnetic charger keeps it in place to charge. The screen lines up with the Mac's screen, so you can see the display while the watch is in Night Stand mode.

Summary
The charging/connection cable for the new iPhone 6 / iPad Air is smaller than previous cables and is prone to breaking at the joint between the connector and cable through use. This is a solution to help prevent cables from breaking. 
Unlike alternative methods available to counteract this problem the Springy Apple Cable Saver does not just transfer the flex / break point away from the cable / connector joint to another point further up the cable. 
The Springy Apple Cable Connector all but stops movement in the cable / connector joint area and also controls the degree of curvature in the springy area. This stops kinking / tight curves that can weaken the cable over time. The springy area is 'springy' to make the cable spring back to near straight as much as possible... graduating / minimizing curvature that can result in it breaking.
Three .stl files have been provided. They include the device end only, the usb end only and both ends in one file. 
This prints well on a Replicator 2 / 5th Generation Replicator but the spring and designed in internal support pin may prove challenging for some machines. PLA is recommended to make it really springy when 3 shells and a high percentage of infill is used. 
Hopefully this proves beneficial to lots of Apple device owners...
Note: If you like this check out the rest of my practical and fun designs.

Notes:
Recommend using 3 shells and 75% infill with PLA to ensure the Springy Apple Cable Savers are strong and... springy.
Use a Raft for a secure base as this will help ensure the springs print well (although they will always be a bit stringy underneath due to movement and the angle).
Do not use support. The required support is a designed in pin up the centre that should push out easily after printing (Refer to images)
Post-Printing
Support removal...
Refer to the images. 
The designed in centre support pins should push easily out of the centre. They are necessary to minimise movement of the spring during printing.

At the risk of sounding obvious, I would recommend printing the apple in red, and the stem/leaf in green. The stem pressure fits nicely into the apple, but a spot of glue couldn't hurt. Enjoy :)

More rounded off Apple watch stand/dock.
Based of a similar design but the back is smoothed out, cable slots correct size with bigger radius as to lessen chance of damaging the cable over time.
There's also a slot where you can push the charger out of the dock for easier disassembly.

Yet another apple watch stand.  This one is built from 3 parts.  Designed so that the cable is hidden.  Also added some holes in the base that are sized to fit a few stacks of American pennies which makes the base quite heavy and stable.  The cable is routed through all three parts and out the back of the base.  
Instructions
Print at 0.2-0.3 layer thickness, and 15-20% fill.  Should fit together without glue, but as with all 3D prints, your printer may vary.  Scale parts up or down 1-2% to make them fit if needed.

Summary
It's that time of year again, and now that my apple tree is finally producing decent fruit, I'd like to be able to get it apple-by-apple without having to go get a stepladder or dropping an entire branch of apples on the ground.  They sell two-claw grippers at the local Home Despot, but grabbing a sphere with two fingers requires more dexterity than I'm willing to invest.  Also, those grippers are only three feet long at best, and I want the apples dangling six or seven feet from the reach of my hand.  
This four-bar-linkage claw is driven closed by a sliding collar attached by another four-bar to each of the three fingers.  The collar is sprung to return the fingers open, so it can be operated by pulling a cord.  For simplicity, the cord has been knotted onto a sliding collar further down the pole to manage it better.  At some point I may redesign this collar to a squeeze-grip lever, but for now, I just want my apples.
The best part?  This threads onto a standard broom handle, which means you don't have to store a six-foot pole outside of apple season... or at all, if you already have a broom.  And if you want a sixteen-foot pole, just duct-tape your broomstick onto another pole (or two?) and use a longer cord.  
Also, a word to the wise-  apples are best picked with a twist, not a pull.  If you stretch some silicone surgical tubing over the fingers, or wrap them with the professional-grade uncured rubber electrical tape (not the cheap vinyl crap), you should be able to get a good enough grip to twist loose the apple without breaking the spur and hurting the tree.  
So a few comments after using this thing... it does work, but it's not quite as plug-and-play as you'd hope:
-The jaws do not close completely because the first level linkages go vertical at about 1"" apart... but that's fine for picking apples.
-It takes a good bit of force on the line to get the jaws to close, and the return spring that I used could do with a bit more punch.  The apples pick best if you trap the stem between two fingers so you can give it a good twist.
-I'm looking for some of that good rubber electrical tape at my local hardware so I can better cushion the fingers, get a better grip and avoid bruising the apples.
Instructions
Besides the broom handle and an appropriate length of cord, you will also need a compression spring that fits over a 16mm dia rod, and 19 3mm or 1/8"" dowel pins, or a similar sized pivot rod.  (You might be able to get away with M3 machine screws in the short term, but it will eat your pivots over time.)
These parts are kitted into two pallets for an Up! Mini.  I have also provided an STL of the assembly for reference only.
Deraft all the parts and nip off the two spacer norkers.  Ream out the bores on all twelve links to match your pivot rod diameters, so they spin free without wiggle.  Ream one side only of the bore sets on fingers and the receiver brackets on the gripper head and gripper mount, so you can insert the pin on the free side and press it in on the far side.  If you screw this up, you can superglue it in.  Ream out the crossbore on the slide rod and the matching crossbore on the gripper mount, one side only.
Load the gripper head onto the slide rod so that the head of the rod sits in the recess of the gripper head. Load the spring onto the slide rod, and then insert the slide rod into the gripper mount bore.  Align the crossbores and press in one of your pins to fixture the slide rod into the gripper mount.
The gripper head should now slide freely on the slide rod, and compress the spring against the gripper mount.
Assemble the links so that they match the illustration, with the numbers correctly aligned.  Press in the pivot pins to set the links.
Assemble the fingers to the links to match the illustration, pressing in the pivot pins.
Thread the cord through the right bushing on the gripper mount, the right bushing on the gripper head, through the crossbore on the gripper head, through the left bushing on the gripper head, and the left bushing on the gripper mount.  You can either tie this into a loop below the mount and run a single cord to the slide handle, or you can run both cords to the slide handle.
Thread the broom handle into the gripper head.  Slide the slide handle onto the broom handle from the bottom, and set it to a comfortable height.  Thread the cord(s) through the provided holes and knot it at the appropriate height so that when the claw is shut, the slide handle is still a comfortable distance from the end of the broom handle.
Go pick something.

How I Designed This
Summary
UPDATED! Larger USB opening
Apple changed the USB cable at some point to make them larger so I increased the size substantially. Sorry for all who had issues with this.
This charging stand is designed specifically for the 44mm Series 4 Apple Watch.
So far there are two versions, one with the Apple logo and one without.
If you'd like me to include a version for the series 0-3 watches let me know in the comments.
The design has fairly tight tolerances in terms of the fit with the charging puck. It should snap into place perfectly but it will take a little squeezing. To remove the charging puck, insert a pen/pencil/chopstick up through the hole in the bottom and push it out.
If you have time to post a make, I’d really appreciate it, I love to see them! My favorite part of sharing my designs is seeing the makes!

Summary
The Smart Stand is a holder /  stand for use with modern smart devices. The stand comes in a phone or tablet version and was designed to enable users to hold their device on a specific angle for video calls and staged photos in particular... but it's also a great little stand for general use. 
Tips: Tips are welcomed and appreciated but, due to where I live, Paypal Me is not available. However, tips can still be sent as a regular PayPal payment to muzz64nz@gmail.com. Thanks in advance! 
Most other phone / tablet stands have a fixed angle or, if they can be adjusted, are limited to a number of angles that may or may not be just right for the video or photo needs at the time. 
The basic concept of this design is that it should hold any phone or tablet and be angle adjustable from nearly vertical (-5°) to tilted way back back and close to horizontal (i.e. at an unusable angle for photos and video / -70°). Although the number of devices this has been tested on is limited, the files posted should work in this way for most phones and tablets. 
The holder should accommodate and function well with any phone or tablet up to 15mm thick. Just drop the phone or tablet into the holder, tilt back with the nut and bolt loosened to some extent then tighten at the desired angle... very simple. If your phone or tablet is thicker than 15mm all parts can be uniformly scaled up to accommodate the greater thickness (eg. Your tablet measures 16.5mm. Divide this value into the standard maximum of 15mm and the result is 1.10... so scale all parts up uniformly by 10%).  
The assembly is also very compact. The phone version measures just 65mm x 35mm (excluding the nut and bolt) or 65mm x 49mm (with the nut and bolt... which only increases the width on one end. In the closed position the stand is 22.5mm tall. In use the stand and holder parts rotate to extend to a maximum length of 105mm. The tablet version is 10mm longer when closed and 20mm longer when opened and is 90mm wide instead of 35mm (i.e. the tablet version closed is 75mm x 90mm). The tablet version needed to be wider to accommodate the extra width of a tablet and longer so tablets inserted in the portrait orientation are less likely to want to flip the stand backwards at angles greater than 45°. The additional 10mm in length achieves this on the tablets tested.      
There are four parts to be printed... the holder, the stand, the bolt and the nut. They are all easy prints if well sliced with a precise app and printed on a well set up machine. Make sure you download the correct versions... all tablet or all phone. However, the 'nut' is common to both assemblies. 
Assembly is also quick and easy although a degree of force is required to push the holder and stand parts together. This is necessary to push past the tapered sections which are there to ensure the stand can be easily locked in place at any angle... so the stand won't flop down under the weight of the phone or tablet. The tapered sections increase the mating surface areas being tightened together by the nut and bolt. The end result functions well with all phones and tablets tested.   
Please refer to the print settings, images and additional information provided to help ensure great results. Please also post images of your Smart Stand/s in use for other members to see.

Simple assemble required...
The Rotating Phone Stand can be assembled in a matter of minutes. The stand and holder parts will need to be forced together which will require a degree of force... but take your time... be patient and don't use excessive force and they will snap together (as shown in the images provided). 
This aspect is important as the design uses tapered section to ensure the stand can be tightened easily and grip well to hold the phone on the desired angle (not flop down).
Make sure the holder and stand orientation is correct as shown in the photos. It is possible to assemble these parts 180 degrees from the correct orientation which will mean the stand does not function as intended.

The 'Apple Flip-top Box' is a must print for every Apple fan...
This is a one piece print of an Apple logo shaped container for small things. The top / lid of the box is hinged so it flips backwards to open. 
At standard scale the internal storage area measures approx. 54mm (W) x 51mm (H) x 41mm (D).. It can be scaled up but scaling down is not recommended as it will reduce clearances so moving parts may fuse together. Even at standard scale a small amount of 'wriggling' may be required to break the top / bottom free from each other so they move freely. 
This is a straight forward PLA print (ABS may be a challenge due to the extreme angles used in a few areas). It should be a straight forward print for machines with a filament fan and good bridging capability. 
Wall thicknesses have been kept thin to minimize filament consumption and print time. Raft is optional. Do not use any automated support as it could fuse the hinge and fill the internal storage area. To ensure it is strong use a minimum of 25% infill. 
This is a very cool little storage design. Use it your self or as a gift for any Apple fan. 
Please refer to the instructions and images for additional information.
Note: If you like this check out the rest of my practical and fun designs.... and post images of your prints!  
Tips: Tips are not expected but are appreciated as they help offset my filament costs as much as anything else. However, as I live outside the USA tips cannot be sent to me via PayPal.Me as that service is not supported in my region and this is beyond Thingverse's control. If you feel like sending a tip please use regular PayPal and send it to muzz64nz@gmail.com and, to those who do,  thanks in advance!

Ready to use straight away...
As the clearances applied are quite tight you may need to gently free the two halves (Upper / Lower). A few gentle wriggles is all that should be required. If more force is necessary try gently running your finger nail or a craft knife around the seam between the halves (Note: In the prints completed so far on my Replicator 2 and 5th Gen Replicator the halves could be easily freed by hand with minimal effort). . rnrn

UPDATE: 27/01/2017:
Fixed the sizing problem some users reported.
I would recommend printing a couple at the same time so the prints have time to cool off.. or at least decrease the print speed. 
I got tired of forgetting the lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter for the iPhone 7, so I made a key-chain to hold on to it :)

I've created a very simple stand for the Apple Pencil. There are three different versions. High and Low tolerance models depending on the resolution of your printer. I use a Flashforge Dreamer and the low tolerance model at the highest resolution holds my Apple Pencil perfectly. I've also included a low tolerance model with the apple logo for the hardcore fans.
NOTE: If you downloaded the low tolerance models on 12/10/15 I don't recommend printing them. The pencil wouldn't fit in my test print. 
gcodes are for Flashforge Dreamer

My iPhone 5 earbuds don't fit my ears and fall out by just turning my head, I have to cram them in and they still fall out. I've designed  support clips that slide on the stem of the earbuds and hook comfortably around the ear. Using the clips my Apple earbuds are comfortable and won't fall out :-)  
If there's interest in this solution I'd be willing to offer a couple of different sizes.
If you really need these but don't have access to a 3D printer I'd be willing to print these and drop them in a first class envelope for a small fee, a good way to pay for more plastic :-)
Thanks.
Tom
Instructions
I printed this thing in ABS using .15mm layers at 20% infill. I ran the STL through Netfab so it is clean and ready to slice.   
You can set the depth of your earbuds by swapping the clips, refer to the photos, the clip is always in front of the ears.

My design for a stand that holds both the Apple iPhone MagSafe and Apple Watch wireless chargers so you can view and charge both devices at the same time. It holds both chargers flush with the front face of the stand and features a groove to route the cables down and out the back.
Just a bit better than the first version, new features include a more hidden cable routing with  retention tabs, a skinnier but deeper foot print than the first one I made, all while being easier to print in my opinion. Let me know what you think.
EDIT 9/24/22:
I added a slimmer profile version of the stand that should work with the newer iPhones that have larger camera bumps. Look for the 2x files marked 'slimmer v1'

Update 18th of January 2016
As a thanks for the massive amount of downloads and feedback, here are updated versions for both sizes and a completely new version (also for both sizes).
The files named ""H6"" are updated from the old version, they have a slightly thicker frame to prevent breaking when the charger is inserted. Some sanding/filing is still required unless you want to scale it up to 101-103%. Hard to say exactly how much, as all printers are slightly different. This version needs support, and maybe a raft (I use rafts).
The files named ""T1"" are completely new. Even smaller than the previous version and needs no support. The cable exits on a slightly higher angle, so it might interfere with some bands, let me know if that is the case and I'll see what I can do. The higher angle makes it so that its flat on your nightstand even without the weight of the watch, or something tacking it down to the surface. My custom 24mm nylon-strap which is rather stiff works fine with this, but any feedback is appreciated. The only finish-work I did was to remove the raft.
The 38mm-versions are not tested (as I don't have one), so if they're wrong please let me know as soon as possible.
Hope you like it! :)
My prints were done at 0,2mm layer height, 3 shells, 8% infill, with raft, support on ""H6"", none on ""T1"".
Inspired by the ""Nightstand-mode"" in watchOS 2, here's a couple of horizontal nightstand-charging-stands... I use some blue-tack on the underside to prevent it from sliding around when I try to shut the alarm up in the morning. Enjoy. :)
Instructions
Rotate 90 degrees so that the base is flat on the buildplate. 200 micron, 2-3 shells,. Maybe a raft. Support only needed on ""H6"".

Apple / iPhone / iPad owners will appreciate this little 'accessory'...  
This Apple logo shaped key fob is best printed in two colours. Just pause your machine as per the instructions provided and change your filament colour to suit.   
At standard size it measure approx. 32mm (W) x 40mm (H) x 6mm thick so is quick and easy to print. There is a small amount of designed in support that should come away easily along with the Raft.   
Note: If you like this check out all my other designs!  
Instructions
On a Replicator 2 this prints well at Standard 0.20mm Resolution / 3 Shells / 65% infill (so it is strong and will last well on your key ring).   
With MakerBot Desktop if you use Raft change colours at 2mm (35% complete) and 6mm (85% complete. The mm change points can be set to automatically pause the machine on 4th Generation MakerBot's but on 5th Generation models and other machines you will need to manually pause it around the percentages given.  
If you aren't using Raft change at 1mm and 5mm (I.e. Raft is approx. 1.0mm to 1.2mm thick).   
Refer to the images provided for more information.

Summary
The original Apple logo, like you have never seen before!
In the instructions, an ingenious way of getting the color layers right is explained, credits go to ""zeq"" for this.
go to : embedables.wordpress.com
for more information on the purpose of this thing
Instructions
Print in the right color combination for the complete experience!
If you don't have all the colors at hand, buy them from a supplier that has them. For example , faberdashery.co.uk has a Rainbow fun pack with 10 colors.
When using the provided g-code, if you want to get the width of each color in your print to be exactly equal and a 6th of the total height, and you have an Ultimaker with a 0.4mm nozzle, use the provided handy filament cutting sheet, or just the dimensions on it. This will make a nicely sized(63mm high)decorative object.
However, if you want to do this with anything else than the above mentioned setup, do the following,
1) Measure the amount of filament that your machine takes in per E's in your g-code. Do some experiment like, making the machine push 1000E's, 500E's or 5000E's, and look at the mm's of filament that went in the exturder. Now you know how many mm goes in say, 1000E's
2) Generate g-code for the thing(note that you need a fill for this print, especially to support the stem.), open it and look at the Z number at the last lines and note this down. This is how high your object is going to be in mm's.
3) Do the following calculation
(total height of object) / 47 x 6 = the width of each color for your object.
4) Now that you have the height for each color, you can determine at what height in your object they are going to start. Note down the starting heights of each color.
5) Next, you can look again at the Z numbers in your g-code. First, find the point where Z is the closest to the width of your first color. For example, if the width is 8.04mm, look for something like 8.02 or 8.06. Just find the closest one. 
6) When you find the right Z number, look at the E number behind it. Note this down.
7) Repeat step 6 until the green color. Note down each E number behind the corresponding Z number.
8) Calculate the difference in E numbers for each color layer.
9) Finally, divide these differences in E numbers by the mm/E that you calculated in step 1. This will give you the length of filament for each color.
10) Cut the filaments in the correct size and preferably join them before printing by your favorite method of choice. If you haven't done this before, look around a bit for how people do it.
Note: Actually, you don't want to cut the green, because if you do, you will have the risk of running out of filament for your print because of the small miss-calculations. Also, if using a Bowden tube, you will need more filament to push the green to the hot-end anyway.
11)Print away!

My Anet A6/A8 Upgrades
Summary
IMPORTANT: Get the latest updates for this model here on PrusaPrinters.
In 2021, all updates and uploads of new models were moved to PrusaPrinters, of course still free and under the same conditions... :)
Manual bed leveling the Anet A6/A8 is a little awkward and could be made a lot easier. There are some good solutions on the net - I took the best, made modifications and kept it simple.
This solution allows you to cover the entire hotbed with a build plate as you no longer need access to adjusting bolts from the build surface. All adjustment is done with the thumbwheels!
All metal! at the hot end - this allows you to heat up the bed for ABS, Nylon and other high temperature filaments without melting your bed level adjustment.
>> Don't forget, if you like it, please leave a like or a tip...  :)
From the kit you will need:
4x Springs
4x Screw M3*30
Additional you will need:
8x M3 Nut (Optional: Use self-locking nuts for thumbwheels)
4x Steel/nylon M3 washer (Optional: I used large, but regular is OK)
4x Spring Cap (Print model)
4x Thumbwheel (Print model)
A 3mm or 1/8"" drill for stripping M3 thread
Note: To make this bed level upgrade, you need to strip the M3 thread in the Y carriage aluminum frame. This can not be reversed.
If your heatbed has copper traces under the washers, I recommend using nylon washers instead of metal to protect the heating element (eBay Search).
Just follow the photos to assemble.The M3 nuts is a tight fit in the thumbwheels to prevent them falling out.
2018 January 13.: Added thumbwheel for Nylock nuts.

How I Designed This
Summary
UPDATE 31-12-2016: Some people had problems with the Frame_L and Frame_R so I have update these files. they are a little bit stronger now. If you have problems with the size, you can contact me and i will make a smaller version for it :D
I have made this upgrade for my Anet Anet A6 and A8 3D printers to get the X-Belt to make it easy tighten it up.
Two friends of my asked me to make one and I wanted to make one myself so that's why I created this tensioner.
You will need to use this tensioner all parts 1 time(Frame_L and Frame_R are the same!). Also, you will need in total 5 M3 screws and bolts(1x ~30mm and 4x ~10mm).
A great youtuber maked a video about this model:

Bed level and Z offset test to make easy on the fly changes.
I found with the level tests that print shapes in the 4 corners of the bed too difficult to see to make accurate adjustments before the print moves onto the next corner.
This test prints a continuous stripe across the entire bed back and forth to identify any warpage or level issues so it's easy to make instant Z offset or level wheel changes.
As simple as this design is i've found it more difficult to print perfectly than most of the corner print tests.
Make sure that your slicer starts the print at the beginning of the stripe and not half way through

How I Designed This
Summary
I just got my first printer and this is my first own design. Comments and reviews are welcome!
How did I end up making my own bed level locks? Well, after spending quite some time leveling, especially the fine tuning after ABL (E3S1Pro users probabely know, that ABL isn't perfect and needs subsequent adjustments on the fly), I thought I'd like to lock this state in place. Unfortunately, all bed locks I could find had to be installed prior to leveling, since they are mostly attached using the screw. I didn't think about this beforehand but also didn't want to level again, so I made something that can be attached after leveling.
Just click one onto each knob's rim in the closest position to the base plate. That way you create your own point of reference and accidental movements can be readjusted very easily. If you click two onto each knob it's actually locked, but the original knobs don't allow for super tight positioning of two.
Design is super small and printed quickly. The cheapest PLA is sufficient. I designed it for the Ender 3 S1 Pro. Not sure which other Crealities these might fit. Please help others and post a comment, if you tested them for different printers!
Please enjoy!

Summary
A more precise way to dial in your CR-10's bed. Fits over existing bed knobs. 
M4 threads have a 0.7mm pitch, so turning the knobs 1/7 of a turn will change the distance 0.1mm.
I beveled the face and added numbers so you could read numerical adjustment. Each big point is 0.1mm. Small points are 0.02mm. Bigger numbers mean a bigger gap.
The file named ""cr10_thumbdial_ws_idig3d.stl"" is with support. The support is a solid ring you can snap out when the print is completed. A screwdriver may help.
Contribute to my coffee fund if you find this useful and want to encourage my insanity. Thanks!

Post-Printing
If you printed the 'ws' (With Support) version, snap out the ring.
Remove each bed knob one at a time.
Press the knob into the thumbnail.
Screw back on the bed screw.
Repeat for all four screws.
Relevel the bed.
I usually print a few lines of a skirt around my prints and turn the dials to get the bed dialed in.

Summary
This knob / thumbdial / thumbwheel is designed for the Alfawise U20 / U30 heatbed.
Other models here on Thingiverse (for the CR-10) are designed for different knobs and don't work with the Alfawise U20 / U30.
This upgrade is designed to include the 18 teeth original adjusting knobs. You don't need to scale it, tolerances are already good. I tried to make it printable as fast as possible, it will take 1,5/2 hours to finish.
Update | Added a smaller variant because the original one was too big for the Alfawise U30.

Originally created by user jmjheaton on XYZ Printing, I fixed the headboard in Meshmixer and remodeled the bed frame in Tinkercad. Uses a common Brillo sponge which you can probably find at your local grocery store. The bed model in the photo came out a bit too large for the sponge, I will scale the next one to about 90%.
Thanks to reddit user throwaway_draw for the sketch!
Print Settings
Notes:
Print the headboard standing up with a wide brim for better bed adhesion. Print the pillows with the flat face down and the pillows sticking up, no supports needed. Whittle some short pieces of bamboo skewers, dowels or finishing nails to attach the headboard to the frame. Use some dabs of glue to hold everything together.

You can use these squares to easily level your bed. Print them out and then adjust each corner individually. If the surface is rough, lower that corner and if it's not sticking at all or you see gaps between the lines, then raise that corner slightly. Keep going until all of the squares are smooth and you should get a perfect first layer.
This version is intended for bed sizes of 200x200mm. Here are links for other bed sizes:
300x300mm
150x150mm

How I Designed This
Summary
Cute mini Octopus, articulated and printed without additional supports.
It's designed so it can be printed at once. No assembly or supports required.
Many different STL files, with straight or spiral tentacles, both with and without included support.
UPDATE!! v6 fixes some mesh errors, improves bed adhesion, and adds the replaceable tentacle and the HUGE octopus print.
To print the small replaceable tentacle, be sure to enable ""print thin walls"" in the slicer. No need for additional supports. Settings are the same as the Octopus 2.0 tentacle replacement video
To print the HUGE tentacle, manual supports are needed in the opened link.

Many people have advised that this does not fit the V2 of the wanhao duplicator i3. Be wary, and use a remix of this design if you have that printer. I don't have a wanhao i3 any more so won't be making a replacement.
Little clamps to locate your glass bed in the XY axis'.  
Per clamp, you'll need:  
2x M3 bolt or grub screw (minimum 10mm thread length)
2x M3 nut (or M3 tap)
[OPTIONAL] Thermally isolating M3 washer - I used a glass fibre washer, but nylon, rubber, or similar will be fine.
Your bed does need to be disassembled to install this, as the clamp is bolted into place through the riser bolts that hold the bed to the Y carriage.  
If you've made the (highly recommended) M3 nyloc nut mod to the bed levelling bolts, they are used to secure the clamp in the Z axis. If not, use the levelling spring, but it may wear as it is tightened and loosened over time.  
I also recommend you print this in ABS, due to thermal properties and to avoid warping when your bed gets to temp.

What!? No guns? Where's the old ultra violence, you say? I know nothing of knitting. My sister in law asked for a loom that could come apart. I said ok.
She hasn't told me she hates it yet. I believe she wanted it for knitting an ""infinity scarf(?)"". I have not tried knitting with this.
Instructions
Print at least 1 ""Break_Loom_v3_Barb"", and 3 ""Break_Loom_v3"". The ""Break_Loom_v3r"" model can be used to created larger loom shapes. Print it sturdy. The spires have integral supports built into them. They require an unnecessary force for knitting to break. Extra walls, and at least .2 infill should suffice. Your gcode may treat the female connecter oddly. It is ok if the circular part prints funky. The inner ring is more of a guide for the sturdy outside supports.

Size - diameter (mm)  
5.5 - 16.10mm
6 - 16.51mm
6.5 - 16.92mm
7 - 17.35mm
7.5 - 17.75mm

10.5 - 20.20mm
11 - 20.68mm
11.5 - 21.08mm  
IMPORTANT: as the ring size is not very big and every printer has different settings, the diameter could be slightly different when printing it. Be careful!  
Hope you like it!

This mousetrap was inspired by a Youtuber named Shawn Woods, who showcases different mouse and rat trap designs in his Mousetrap Monday video series. I sent this trap to Shawn, and he has featured it on his channel. 
See it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5MAXYJjcUI
Note: My printer was too small to print the lid so I had to split the lid and the rest of the trap up to print it. The 3D files posted here are not split, and the lid snaps in place securely.
This particular trap design is over 140 years old.
Check out the video of an original antique trap in action on Shawn's channel!

A 3D version of the Maker Faire robot. Is a very good ""Hello world"" test for 3D printers.  We used it as a key test print (http://bit.ly/19tLvG4 ) for our 2014 Ultimate Guide to 3D printing, available from the Maker Shed: http://www.makershed.com/Make_Ultimate_Guide_to_3D_Printing_2_0_p/9781457183027-p.htm.  
Based on Kim Dow's Maker Faire robot illustration, this model was designed by MAKE Labs Engineering Intern, Eric Chu: http://www.thingiverse.com/Chu  
For more information on how this model came about, check out Eric's blog post on MAKE: http://blog.makezine.com/2013/01/15/3d-printable-maker-faire-robot/
Instructions
UPDATE: V6 robot now have closed mesh. Download this one!  
Recommended settings:  
0.1mm - 0.2mm layer height  
hollow  
2 perimeters/walls/shells   
Settings for arms down robot with supports:  
0.1mm layer height (the supports needs to be printed at this layer height for them to snap off easily)   
For those printing with Ulimakers, included is a recommended Cura profile.   
Note for Slic3r users: Slic3r has trouble generating tool paths for the ""M"" on the chest and the MAKE logo on the back. Scaling up the part to 200% seems to fix this, but the robot will be larger. As always, check your gcode before you print! Here's a simple in-browser gcode viewer: http://www.buildlog.net/gview/index.html

While no one has discovered a way to defeat our enemies the Chronophages, the engineers at KONGO! have devised a new weapon to monitor the progress of the time stealing fiends.  
Print your own Kongotronic 3000 Series TIME DEFENDER and not only will you never again be in doubt that time IS BEING STOLEN FROM YOU, but you'll know precisely HOW MUCH time!  
And you can help improve the TIME DEFENDER! There are expansion ports on the head that have yet to be utilized. There is a submission form upon which you can doodle your ideas. Build the ideas yourself, or send them to KONGO! and perhaps we'll include them in a future update.  
Be sure to ""watch"" this object, there will be updates. Like what? Well, right now there's a hook on the robot's back so it can be hung on a wall, but its tank treads are too long to allow that. Alternate legs will have be made. And doesn't he need a big ray gun to hold?  
Don't need a clock, you say? There's plenty of room in that big ol' body to hold other projects. Projects involving meters are a perfect fit.  
UPDATE 3/19/2013 - Now with Easter Bunny ears accessory
UPDATE 12/22/2013 - Now with Santa Hat - Can be printed without support (has a breakaway support built in, under the tab that holds the hat on the robot's head).  
COMING SOON - PAPERCRAFT VERSION  
Hey folks, I'm a freelancer. I put many hours into this project, not to mention countless meters of 1.75mm PLA filament, making sure this would be an exceptional Thingiverse contribution. Heck, I even created a faux package design so you can make a nice gift box. If you appreciate this level of work, if it puts a smile on somebody's face, if you tip well at restaurants, consider some form of patronage. Whether it's a few dimes, a few dollars, or a few meters of filament, I'd be very grateful. I'll even add your name to a patron list on this page. Message me through Thingiverse or my direct email,  ""kongorilla at yahoo dot com"" (please convert to a real address). My paypal account is linked to that yahoo address as well. Thanks!  
Need some modeling work done? Contact me for that, too.  
PATRON LIST  
A special THANK YOU TO Bluemetal for becoming the first patron for this project!  
davelandia - Thank you for your patronage!

Trevor L from the Great White North - email me for a proper thank you! (I couldn't reply to your payment)
BigLazyB - Thanks for your amazing generosity!  
Instructions
All the files you need are in the zip file.
You'll need a quartz clock movement. They're commonly found in craft stores or in the cheap clocks you've got in your garage because you don't like them anymore. I'm not sure how standardized they are, but the three I found in my house were virtually identical (above is a photo of the movement I used). I'm anticipating some variation, though, so if the movement mount or dial doesn't fit your clock movement, shoot me a message with the specs you need and I'll be happy to make adjustments for you.
You'll also need a small amount of glue. I used super glue. I also used stick glue to attach the paper printout of the clock dial to the printed part it goes on. I was surprised how well the stick glue worked on PLA.
Printing and assembling the clock should be fairly straight forward, though time consuming. I've included instructions for assembling the arms because they have to be done in a particular order (see picture). I'm hoping all other questions are covered by the exploded view (see another picture). The clock movement and mount have to be pushed in from the back. 
All the visible parts have mesh topology that is subdivision surface compatible. So, if you have a printer that is much better than mine and you can see unwanted polygon facets, you can go into the Blender file and raise the subdivisions for the offending object. Hurray for virtually infinite resolution! This model will be useful for years to come, even when we're printing parts for our flying cars. I didn't use Blender-specific features on the mesh (such as marking hard edges), so the model can be subdivided in any software package that supports subdivision surfaces (pretty much all mesh modeling programs).

Articulated Robot design. His name es Ankly
It is printed articulated, without need of later assembly.
A challenge for your printer, you must adjust it well to be able to print it since the tolerances for the joints are minimal.
Once printed it is necessary to review and remove the small supports of the piece.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkAjQNrZWSM
You will find two files one at 100% in size and another at 80%.
( 100% size it is easier to get good results)
On request I added file without supports (100 size Ankly without supports.stl). With this file it is necessary to add supports to be printed.

As the joints have little friction, it is possible to construct a puppet.
If on the other hand you want to add friction, you can put liquid latex on the joints.

This Flexi Fokobot is a collaboration between Flexi Factory and Fokoos.
It's an articulated print-in-place robot that needs NO supports, No assembly, and prints great with PLA
Flexi's are really fun to play with because they flop around and move in any which way.
Like with all my Flexi's, I went through several iterations to make sure it was strong, and easy to print without supports.
Please feel free to share images of your prints on this page, I would love to see 'em.
Thank you.

Summary
Guardian Robot
After printing the Maker Figure my son and I sat down to design our own robot.  During our concept generation session it quickly became apparent that my son, who is four, was asking me to design a robot that looked very similar to one from a video game he had seen.  With that drawing as a template we built a few prototypes of the body and legs before settling on the parts that have been uploaded.  According to my son, It's perfect, exactly what I wanted.  We hope the maker community enjoys it as well.
Community
noodleyfelix Adapters to flip the leg segment orientation.
Carlos_R Adapter for a 5 mm LED. Check out his awesome build video!
Sonoranguy Modified the feet to remove the rotating claws. The rotating claws can be flimsy which this would fix.
Guardian Leg Segment Check out this improved version of the guardian leg. It no long snaps in, but looks much closer to the original.
Geirskogul Do not use carbon or transparent ABS for the leg segments. Transparent ABS has acrylic in it and it too brittle.
Remixes
Hackable - This remix provides a bunch of space and hooks for electronics such as LEDs and servos.
Details Separate - This separates the details and the robot body to allow for dual extrusion printing.
Inspiration
The PCB Workstation with Articulating Arms provided the inspiration for the robot arms.
Design
My goal was to print the robot in as few parts as possible while ensuring that all of the joints printed cleanly.  
Body
I kept kept the hip joints as part of the body, even though the resulting hips were looser then desired, because I liked the integrated design and the challenge of printing everything in a single shot.  The head rotates in the same manner as the Maker Faire bot. To improve print time and material usage, I hollowed out the model being careful to minimize overhangs.  Most of the model has wall thicknesses of 2-3 mm where possible.  
Arms
The arms took a few tries to get right.  I ended up printing the arm segments separately so that the sections could be snapped in for a tighter fit than would be possible if they were printed in a single shot.  Finding appropriate dimensions for the engagement required trial and error to find segments that did not fall apart easily and still rotated smoothly.  Variables to consider here were the wall thickness, engagement depth, and ball diameter.  The claws use simple cone hinges providing smooth motion.
To Print
Print 1 Body, 6 Claws, and 90 Segments.
I used a raft and no support to build these parts.  The Segment is printed with the ball rotated to be on top and the Claw is rotated to be printed with the claw on the bottom. Print the body with the head rotated to be on top.  
Once printed, the head and hip joints rotated smoothly with minimal sticking.
Optional Files
I've uploaded body_120dia_botwg which should allow the Guardian to be printed on a bed with dimensions of 120 x 120 x 120.  This was modified by cutting a small portion off the OD of the original.  
Caution
Reducing the size may cause the parts to freeze or prove brittle.  I used a minimal gap to allow the parts to rotate and a minimal wall thickness to conserve material.
Future Work
As with any project, there is always more to do an improve upon.  Here is a my current list.
Complete I left the arms hollow for the potential to add a string or elastic band.
Complete Increase the claw size (almost double).
Complete Create a model with snap in hip joints to provide more friction. [I built this and it worked... however the model required significant tweaking from standard print settings. In order to keep this easy to print, I removed this feature. You can freeze the hips in place with a dab of super glue.]
Complete Add an access hatch to the head and or base for electronics (LEDs) See this remix.
I need to redesign the claws to be more robust. The current hinge fails to easily.

Summary
A fun little robot that prints in one complete piece. Both the arms and legs move. I made him to put in my son's party bags. Robot Mk8 is a work in progress but is fun to play with right now. His feet are compatible with lego bricks.
He stands 60 mm tall from tip of antenna to bottom of feet.
I plan to make more dials for his chest and maybe make his head and hands turn. 
Inspired by jcubed111's Robot Keychain Accessory http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:384213
Update: 10th September 2016
Added a model for a 4 times taller robot. He's 298 grams and takes ~12 hours to print at 350 micron resolution. I didn't scale the fit of the movable limbs so they are all very floppy but he still stands up. He gets a lot of attention. If anyone has trouble with limbs sticking on the original scale version, I recommend scaling the model up a little. That should do the trick if fiddling with the fit parameters is getting you nowhere. 
Update: 7th August 2016
Added option for random dial needle angle (set to -1). Angles between -28 and +28 degrees work well.
Added option for hole for key ring. Hole size not changeable with customizer yet.
Added rotating head joint.

***Leg Files Updated: 3/13/2016 - Modified to increase socket durability.
SkullBot (#SkullBot) is a newly discovered, residual of the #QuinSaga Wars. ...We're still unclear on how he was created but it looks as if a scrapped #RukiBot was reassembled with some human remains. ...Dark, grim, and mysterious we hope that this new creature will become more friend, than foe.
FACTS:
Claw features a 5mm grip! - He holds many Transformer weapons!
Designed to have parts rearranged! - Spider-Skull, anyone?
Arms rotate at wrists!
Features 3DK Spin ports... This allows you to rotate the Utility Pins in their ports.
We at 3DKToys (3DKitbash) developed SkullBot to say thanks to the communities of the various 3D printer websites for letting us know that some of our items had been placed on EBay without permission. Your attention and care for how IP is handled within and around the 3D printing communities is greatly appreciated by 3DK, and we wanted to make something fun for everyone to show our thanks. You all really do help us stay afloat. Thank you all. ~ Natalie and Quincy

After Android Lollipop was announced, I decided I needed recreate the Android Lollipop statue. I ended up creating different hand pieces, which allows for printing different configurations (see instructions).  
Here's a quick video on how to assemble the pieces:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0vYl_B-8Ng  
If you print one (or more), please share images!
Instructions
For printing on my UM2, I print with default infill at 0.2mm height. Only the eyes are printed on 0.1mm height as that makes them a little smoother (and they are very small, so it still prints quickly).   
The head and body need support structure. The other parts print fine without. The body and hands should be printed upside down.   
You need to print the following:  
1x body  
1x head  
1x head ring  
1x set of eyes  
2x shoulder pin  
2x shoulder ring  
2x arm  
2x arm pin  
2x hand (any combination that you desire)   
The hands come in different variants:  
plain  
fingers (hand with 2 fingers like the official lollipop statue)  
4.5mm hole (perfect for holding a Chupa Chups lollipop)  
5.5mm hole (for larger lollipops)  
4.5mm hole half way (for adding accessories to the robot)

Instructions
Summary
A box to hold your Pokemon TCG cards and accessories.  
There's a compartment under the deck to hold counters, and a recess in the top to hold the ""coin"" that comes with the Kalos starter decks.
Instructions
1) Print both pieces.
2) Trim off the corder pads with a knife.  They are only included to improve adhesion during printing.
3) Assemble.  You may find that the detents make the box too difficult to open, in which case I suggest starting to open from the end, or trimming them a bit with a knife.  Or of course feel free to modify the model to reduce or remove them.  
OpenSCAD sources are included if you want to make tweaks.

Low-poly model of Charizard.
We're making a collection of all 151 first gen Pokémon! 151 are finished now. A newer version of a lowpoly Charizard is available in our 151 Pokémon colection that we are making. The size of his polygons better fits with the rest when printed in real scale. You can back the project here: 3D-mon.com
Here are some links to our website and social media where you can see more of our creations.
You can also support us directly here on Thingiverse by sending us a tip so we can make more models.
This fan-made model was brought to life by 3Demon. We are a group of modeling and 3d printing enthusiasts based in Prague, Czech Republic.
Happy Printing :-)

Watch this video to see more of Magnemite: https://youtu.be/YFrfA8L_MxE 
It's a life size Magnemite! I'm a huge fan of Pokémon and I was looking for something that's a relatively simple shape to demonstrate my modeling process for an upcoming video. So Magnemite was perfect. Then I drew some inspiration from The 3D Printing Nerd to make him big!
This didn't take too long to model. It was round 3 hours when all was ready to print. This model is broken up into a few easier to print parts. The main sphere is in 2 parts with the eye on one side and the back being just a half-sphere. Then there are 2 magnets with a magnet pin to allow the magnets to rotate freely in the socket to provide a little more accuracy to the character. Then there are 3 screws that will just fit in the corresponding holes on the model. This model can be pretty easily scaled as well. The smaller version was just scaled down from the big one.
The big version was printed on my Robo3D in PLA and it took close to 40 hours to print everything. The smaller version was printed on my Da Vinci 1.0 Pro in ABS and took about 14 hours to print.
After that my wife attempted to walk me through her painting/post-processing techniques. The smaller one was finished by me, as you can probably tell by the quality. And the bigger one was finished beautifully by my wife. I will have a few videos coming shortly that completely show these processes from start to finish.

After all these months enjoying Thingiverse, here is my small contribution, which has already proven its success!
5 Pokemon cookie cutters:
Squirtle
Pikachu
Bulbasaur
Charmander
Pokeball with or without name
I put an STL of each pokemon, as well as an STL of the pokeball alone.
So I put a pokeball format SLDPRT, so you can add the name of a child for example :-)
(For the pokemon font, look for ""pokemon solid"" on google or whatever, but a classic font works well!)
I also attached a small shortbread recipe to enjoy these beautiful cookie cutters ;-)
EDIT 13/01/2020 : add pikachu classic

Printable with all printers. the exterior walls are 1.55mm. So be sure to put either:

2 layers with wall filling (S3D)
But otherwise everything should be suitable for shortbread successful!
enjoy !

No glue needed, all parts are friction fit. The overhang on the eyes needs good cooling to prevent PLA curling, the head may need some support on the ""chin"". The pupils are very small and can optionally be left out. The other parts are straight forward to print, brim may be used to increase bed adhesion.
A secret compartment can be accessed by removing the head.

[Edit]
I redit the black part:
Measure what size your wristband is and print the version of the black part that fits your band or choose to print it as a necklace/keychain.
The black part without anything added to the name is just the plain part without any holes for wristbands.
If you need/want other types of baseplates so you can wear it differently, just tell me.
Instructions
Print the different parts in the colour as their names tell you.
Measure what size your wristband is and print the version of the black part that fits your band or choose to print it as a necklace.
The black part without anything added to the name is just the plain part without any holes for wristbands.
Put little dabs of superglue on the black part when adding the coloured parts so they don't fall out afterwards.

It's time for Diglett! And no I wasn't magically able to figure out what he's hiding underneath the ground. So that'll remain a mystery.
But this model was pretty fun to do and it should be equally as fun to print as it doesn't require supports. I created it in Fusion 360 using a sketch to revolve the body. Then I used the sculpting mode to create a bumpy ground area around him. Then I added the facial details.
After I printed it, my wife took it, primed it and sanded it a bit to remove the layer lines. Then she painted it with acrylic paints and a paintbrush/sponge.

For today's #3DPrintmas Entry we have Gastly from Pokemon. Gastly and the evolutions are some of my favorites from the first generation of Pokemon.
So I knew that Gastly was an easy shape for the most part, I just didn't know how I was going to do the gas cloud. So I just started modeling. I went into the sculpting environment, pulled out a sphere and just started pulling areas and pushing others in and I just made sure it came into contact with the main sphere. Eventually I got a shape I was happy with that was pretty much just a blob.
Then I printed it out (settings below) and my wife painted it up. After she did a bunch of repairing the print with repair putty and filler primer, she painted it up using an airbrush for the purple of the cloud, and a paintbrush for the black of the body and the other details.

Wild ONIX appeared!  
The 3D model for this originated from this wonderful site that rips Pokemon models from the various games: http://roestudios.co.uk/project/3d-pokemon-models
But then I made it 3D printer friendly!  
I welcome anyone to make improvements / remixes of this.

Instructions
This print was a bit tricky and required a whole lot of supports that were a pain in the Ash to remove. If you can figure out a way to do it with far less supports, I would be delighted to see.  
I printed this on a FlashForge Creator 1 (based off of the Replicator 1)
I used grey ABS and sliced with these settings:

Summary
It is a remix based on this one:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6604714
I am using only the two-battery version. There is no so-called circuit protection as claimed in the original version.
The original battery holder is too tight on the batteries. I got it fixed in my version.
Please also note that this battery holder is more suitable for point-headed cells. Flat top cells may have poor connection.
This 18650 x 2 battery holder has a compact size and is durable. I wanted to use it in a robot but it was missing an ON/OFF switch. From my assortment of electronic components I found a small switch good for this purpose. So this project was to install the switch onto the holder, making it a built-in component.
The switch I used is this one:
https://www.amazon.com/JESSINIE-Miniature-Latching-Electronic-Projects/dp/B0CDGXQC1G
(Buy it from any provider you prefer, not necessarily amazon.)
If you prefer using another switch with a different size, you may have to modify the model.
This is not the smallest switch in the market. I tried using smaller ones but completely failed. It was found that when there is high enough voltage (8V in my case), electricity can pass through air in the very tiny gap between two metals. A mini switch cannot effectively cut off power even when it is turned to OFF.
The original design of the battery holder has a wire bridging two batteries to form a serial connection. This bridging wire is the most convenient place to implant a switch.
There are two STL files provided. The small one is an add-on cover for the switch. If you already have a print-out of the battery holder, solder a new wire with the switch and glue this cover to the holder.
Another STL is an all-in-one design. Having it printed out, you still need:
spring plate set for battery holder x 2 (12 x 12 mm)
a small sliding switch
Solder two wires about 1-2 cm to the switch. Wrap the soldering points by heat shrink tubing. Insert the switch into the holder. Solder the two wires to the two contact points to form a circuit. Test it with batteries to make sure the switch can connect and disconnect power. Finally inject hot glue to the bottom of the switch to seal the wire.
This battery holder was designed during development of this robot:

Summary
Using a flexure spring and an over-center mechanism to create the classic toggle switch in an interesting way.
WobbleToggleSoft.stl has a thinner spring for a softer click and is currently my recommended version. WobbleToggle.stl is the original version and WobbleToggleLoose.stl is the original version but a bit looser (0.3 mm clearances).
Shouldn't need any lubrication, but like all mechanical prints, it can benefit from a little oil, wax, or soap in the joints, especially if you use PETG (which has relatively high friction with itself).
Update 18 July: made some minor changes to the geometry to improve printing and feel.
Update 19 July: made a small chance to the spring to reduce strain in the center.
Update 23 July: added thinner spring version

Just a cute little doll crib designed around the LOL Surprise ""Lil Sisters"" dolls.  This is a simple print requiring no supports, rafts, or brims.  Just print it!  Took me 4 hours total printing time.
As soon as my daughter saw it, she asked for another to fit the bigger LOL dolls.  Not sure if I'll make another design or just scale this up and print again.  I'm sure you can do the same to fit different sized toys and dolls.

How I Designed This
Summary
My girl's dollhouse came with only one bed so they asked for bunks. These were designed for Barbie sized dolls which is why they have strange looking proportions! 
UPDATE Now with a more rounded bed-head (Head_V2). I've left the original so you can see the changes.  
UPDATE Added an alternative version of the beams which use a simple lap joint. 
You need to print 4 of each of the 2 beams and two of each of the ""slats""
The original beams slot together and connect to sockets in the head and foot of the bunks. You will likely need to file the male parts as they are an intentionally tight fit. The alternative beams are simple lap joints which should be assembled with an adhesive and clamped to set. The ""slats"" are thin to save on print time and will also need attaching with your choice of adhesive. I glued all joints with two-part epoxy because the kids would soon work them loose otherwise.

A door stop in the shape of a cow's face, for anyone who loves cows. This object is an extrusion from an image created by gayatri for The Noun Project.

How I Designed This
Specification
I simply wanted a door stop in the shape of a cow's face. Of course it had to hold my door open, so I measured the gap underneath my open door at its largest spot and found that it was about 14 mm, so I rounded up to a final height of 20 mm. So the spec for this project was:
MUST: Be shaped like a cow's face.
MUST: Be adorable.
MUST: Be 20 mm tall.
MUST: Be strong enough to withstand kicking when setting it under the door.
SHOULD: Have a lanyard hole.
This requirement came from my Thingiverse searches. While seeing if anyone had made a cow face door stop before me, I found this Thing by KyleLM, which is a door stop that has a lanyard hole so that the user can tie a string to the door stop, and then secure that string to the door knob. When a person with a sore back needs to unwedge the door, they can pull on the string instead of bending down or kicking at the stop. It also gives you a way to hang the door stop on a hook.
Let's moo!
Processing the original image
An artist going by gayatri posted a cow head icon to The Noun Project, which is one of the best websites ever. I downloaded her icon as a PNG because SVGs confuse and scare me.
I removed the orphaned dot in the middle of its forehead, and then converted the edited PNG to a SVG using Online-Convert.com's SVG converter.
You're probably wondering why I converted a PNG to an SVG instead of just downloading the SVG to begin with. Well for some reason, Tinkercad doesn't recognise SVGs from The Noun Project as valid images, so it wouldn't import it as geometry. Doing it this way, however, works fine.
Uploading to Tinkercad and forming the geometry
I imported the converted SVG to Tinkercad. Tinkercad ignores all of the whitespace and turns all of the black into extruded geometry.
I pulled the extrusion up to a total height of 20 mm, and then elongated the face to make it look more adorable (see Spec MUST #2). This elongation made the eyes ellipses instead of circles, and I felt that the eyes were too low on the face anyway, so I filled the original eyes in and cut new ones at a higher position with cylinder Hole objects.
To produce the slanted profile of a door stop, I made a wedge Hole object and sized it to overlap the whole cow face. I flipped it upside down and then lowered it until its apex was 4 mm above the work surface. After subtracting the wedge from the face, I had a door stop that is 4 mm thick at its lowest point; more than enough space for infill.
Finally, I cut the lanyard hole using a cylinder Hole that I stretched into an elliptical cross-section, and then angled upwards about 45°. Ellipses print more cleanly than circles, and the angled hole would not grind so much against the string tied onto it.

Model is from Pocket Camp, ripped by Centrixe (thank you!). I posed them, added a base and optimized it for printing. They print in two pieces that you glue together at the end.
Printing settings: I’d recommend both a brim and supports. I print at 0.12 mm resolution.
For glueing I use Locite super glue. Line up and glue the base first, then the head once that’s dry. That lets you correct for any warping.
Depending on how it's painted it could be Norma or Patty or any of the cows. If you would like to paint, spray with a primer first then paint with acrylic craft paint. I use the cheap kind from walmart and it works fine, just make sure to thin it with water first.
After painting I spray mine with Krylon Colormaxx Clear - Flat to protect the paint.

How I Designed This
Summary
3D scanned from a small metal highland cow figurine. The original mesh file had flat feet, so while it still prints without modifications, the more stable print is the 'highland_cow_flatfooted' file. 
Print with supports and with either brim or skirt bed adhesion. Prints at any size I have tried.

Cow Cork Pal, I saw these other pals http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:214766 and I thought they were missing a cow so I added one.

I printed with support, I took the legs up a bit because i did not like them on the ends of the body, so support is required.

You thought it was a real cow, and it fooled you! Well, guess what. You were wrong. IT WAS A PLYWOOD CUTOUT THIS WHOLE TIME!
This model was extracted from the game files, and converted to a printable version. Made during the 2017 72hr TF2 Winter Jam.

Link's House from Ocarina of Time  
Complete with cow that Malon gives to Link as a reward for being the best jockey.  
Removable roof!
Pokemon Fans: Check out my Real Working Fully Functional 3D Printed PokeDex
Instructions
I'd recommend printing all the pieces at 0.1 mm layer height,
except for Tree and Roof - print those at 0.3 mm layer height because they are larger and will take much longer to print.  
Print these with NO SUPPORTS:
Deck
Mushroom
Ladder
Railing_left
Raling_right
Railing_print2 (Print this piece twice)
Tree
Vines
Window  
Print these with EXTERIOR SUPPORTS:
Cow
Link
Roof  
Then paint the pieces, and glue them together with super glue.
Don't glue the roof on though, it just sits on top.

Identification ear tags have always been a problem. If you use blank tags and write with an ear tag pen, they fade and become unreadable. I you use commercially printed, (ink, not 3d) tags, you need to order a lot of tags, they are expensive and if you lose one you cannot replace it with the same number.
12 months ago I tried my first 3d printed ear tags and so far have had 100% success.
They are printed from TPU and are extremely durable, easy to read and can be printed as required. They work out a lot cheaper too.
You can change colours for year, sex, paddock identification.
They fit the standard ear tag applicator gun.
https://www.fmb.com.au/leader-applicator-standard-deluxe.html
The male part needs to be purchased separately as you would normally do for commercial ear tags.
https://www.fmb.com.au/button-male-plain-no-printing.html
To customize your own tags, copy this workspace in Onshape and edit the text and size as required.
https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5863832aeed541b703b8579a/w/a5c30d8d412f17253335b119/e/c1d6dfc8dbf670c13c504623

This ring and plug are placed on opposite sides of a tarp or fabric and lock together. Holes in the plug allow an attachment point stronger than most store-bought ""tarp clips"". Great for blanket forts and/or snowstorms.  
To Use: Secure your rope to the plug with a cow hitch (as shown). Bunch your tarp around this plug and place this bunch through the oval ring. When the ovals are lined up again, they lock together. Carefully pull the tarp taught to flatten it out.
The jumbo version has additional clearance for a thick tarp.
Only pull along the long axis (as shown) for greatest strength.

How I Designed This
Summary
This cow whistle is design from software IME3D KID. In the software I can Change the sound of the whistle by setting the shape of the whistle. 
I use this toy in my science class to teach the structure of the whistle.
The detail software information can visit web: http://en.ime3d.com
How I Designed This
Prepare
I visit web: http://en.ime3d.com/Kid/Index#download , and download the software in my computer.
If you have Android PAD, The installation package of the Android system can also be found in the above link. 
When I installed the software. because this bate is testing version, them are not application for antivirus software white list. So I close my antivirus software and install this software. 
when finish software platform instead, registered account and into platform. this software also need download each apps in Platform, It will cost a little times (about 15 mins in UK).
Design step
When I open this software Platform, it have so many theme design APP in it, and also have two easily design software in it. I open one of the theme design software ""Iwhistle"". 
In the software, there are three styles of whistle for me to choose, I choose a cartoon avatar style. Next, the software entered the step of changing the sound of the whistle by designing the core structure of the whistle. I chose a clear sound. After step is decorative whistle, when finish this step finally you can export STL files.

Some hearders and cattlemen would be out on a long drive for months at a time. The Chuck Wagon was as
important to the drive's success as a good pair of cowboy boots were to the cowboy. These long drives were often 1000
miles in length and could last as long as 5 months.
For a brief history check out my blog post

Newest Cow Skooper Design.  Printed out but had issues with the legs so the set included here is Version 2 which I haven't printed out yet.  Includes files for both whole saucer as well as sliced top and bottom with connector ring for printing without supports.  Legs will require some supports.
Note that this is a re-upload of https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4925528 which isn't appearing in Thingiverse for some reason.  The legs are a little different but everything else is the same.

I made this to hold a cow magnet I use for stud finding, there's a link to the cow magnet I used for dimensions below. The model can likely be resized in your slicer to fit any similarly sized and shaped magnet you might have or find. If resizing, make it slightly smaller than your magnet so the fit is snug.
Use TPU and it will make a good friction fit that requires a decent amount of effort to remove. Add a little super glue if you want and even stronger hold, though it's likely not needed.

If you're curious how a magnetic stud finder works, you wave it across a wall and it will locate the screw/nail heads used to fasten the drywall to the studs. They're more reliable than an electric stud finder, never need batteries and they're cheaper to boot. I'm a carpenter by trade and you'll never see an electric stud finder on a jobsite.

Some simple RPG coins for your D&D game. I'll be adding to this collection over time to make a full currency set + trade ingots.
Print the files and sandwich the two coin sides inside the ring around an M8 Galvanised Washer (2mm high x 20.5mm diameter) to add weight. The top of the pattern on each side should be flush with the ring edge. Use superglue to hold it all together. Paint the whole coin black. Let the undercoat dry then dry-brush with gold.
Remix freely!

1 gp = 10 sp = 100 cp = 2 ep = 1/10 pp

copper ""penny"" (1cp)
silver ""shilling"" (1sp)
silver ""crown"" (5 sp)
gold ""Lion"" (Cormyr) or ""Dragon"" (Waterdeep) (1gp)
gold ""sovereign"" (5gp)
platinum ""Royal"" (Cormyr) ""Suns"" (Waterdeep) (1pp)
Cormyrian & Waterdeep Trade bars
25 gold = 1/2 pound bar of gold (6x4x0.5cm)
100 gold = 2 pound bar of gold (10x5x1cm)
1000 gold = 2 pound bar of platinum (11x5x1cm)
50 coins = 1 pound of weight
100 coins~= 1kg
Gold Pieces are called Golden Lions in Cormyr, Dantars in Amn, Bicentas in Calimport, Dragons in Waterdeep, Shilmaers in Cormanthyr and Dinars in Southern Lands. Sembia mints five-sided coins of the same weight called Golden Lions (not to be confused with the eponymous Cormyrean gold pieces.

For those lucky enough to have a partner sharing a nice can of brain fuel while spending the whole night sitting in front of the printer and watch the PLA flow.  
Yes, I know. It's not a bull, it's a cow. And it's not red, it's blue. And it's useless. Enjoy!  
No idea where I found the original cow stl some 15 years ago on a floppy disk. Not even on the internet. If you are the author of this file and feel uncomfortable seeing your (probably hand written) point cloud being printed on one of these newfangled hipster devices, please drop me a line and I will remove this thing with a cordial moo.

Cow Head is home to one of the longest sandy beaches in Newfoundland as well as a large area of sand dunes. It also has panoramic views of the Long Range Mountains of Gros Morne. An interesting geologic feature found at Cow Head is a section of the former continental margin of Laurentia which dipped into the Iapetus ocean.
There is a walking trail leading to a lighthouse constructed in 1909 on the summer side or ""head"" of Cow Head.

Allowing kids to learn about 3D printing by taking a project from design to printing.
Standards

CCSS
Overview and Background
Before we get started, find some pictures of a cow and observe it’s structure.
Lesson Plan and Activity
Can be used in several courses Math/Art/Science/Practice
Open IME3D KID X Art3D to design this project.
The instroction is in the Video
Step 1 Choose“Drag Elastic”brush to make the chin area here, remember to adjust the brush size so it’ll fit your needs.And the prolonged area should be the neck.
.
Step 2  Squash from back and front sides, try to make this kind of a triangular shape in the front and the back to the neck area, smooth the head and continue drag out the horns.
.
Step 3 Use “Drag Elastic”or “Wrinkle” push the forehead back a little bit also the eyes and checks area. 
.
Step 4 Then we drag out it’s neck, the neck is pretty important, because otherwise we are just making a helmet,looks better now.
.
Step 5 The chin area is a little bit too big so with the “Drag Elastic” brush we can make it smaller but not too small as it is now, push the nose back a little bit, and then switch to “Wrinkle”brush like we did with the eyes area.Drag out the brow ridge because as we can see in the OX-head picture we found, these areas are a little in front of the forehead.
.
Step 6 Now try to make this kind of arch.
.
Last step: ears and the eyes, and add a little bit details.
.
 You can follow the video to make an ox-head or sculpt/knead it as anything you want! Now let’s get started!

This summer while designing a DIY Electronic Drum-kit, I noticed that there existed no CAD model of an Universal Rack-Clamp. So what is a Universal Rack-Clamp? It's the clamp used to put together pipe structures such as a working Rig (the ones used on construction sites) as well as Drum Rigs on Kits (the ones used to customize and hold Toms, Cow Bells etc.). This one's made in OpenSCAD which means it can be customized to different pipe and wing-nut/screw specifications. With replacement rack-clamps running at ~$25 each, printing it is actually about three times cheaper.  
Letâ€™s you make a variety of structures, cost-effectively.

Summary
Let's be honest, the Citroen C5 (Mark III, built since 2008) is a nice and comfortable car perfectly made for long journeys. But during long jurneys I get thursty. So what the hell did they think when they made a single cup holder for the front row and put it under the arm rest?!? I've seen it and decided to never use it.
So where can I put my coffee-to-go or my can of lemonade once it is opened?
My research brought me to the following conclusions:  
There is no cup holder designed specifically for the C5.
All the aftermarket standard cup holders either make that almost premium interior (your personal opinion may differ) look like a 1980s economy car, block the air ducts, cost way too much money, require drilling holes into the dashboard or even combine more of these characteristics.
So I couldn't buy any cup holder, GREAT! Another perfect justification I could give my wife for purchasing that ""are you nuts this is way too expensive"" 3D printer!
Said - done. 2-3 tries for improving printability, stability and usability and there it is:  
Cup holder made for standard sized coffee cups (small, regular, large/grande) as well as normal 330ml and 500ml beverage cans. - - Other sizes (e.g. slim and taller energy drink cans) should fit, too, but I don't have any sample to try.
Simply clip the Cup holder into the panel of the door pocket. The bracket is designed to match the inner shape of it perfectly.
Move it to a position where it doesn't collide with your seat and legs, I prefer the foremost.
Put your cup in there and enjoy! I also use it for my chewing gums.
It fits to the driver and to the passenger door.
Some questions to be answered in advance to save your time for asking:
Q1: Does it hold big bottles in place?
A1: No, it's a cup holder.
Q2: Why didn't you design it to perfectly fit my cool ""red cow"" energy drinks?
A2: Cause I don't drink them.
Q3: Don't you hit it with your leg all the time?
A3: No, actually I have quite a clearance in my ""natural"" sitting position. And also my seat is still pretty far away as you might see in the pictures.
Q4: How reliably does it hold the drinks?
A4: Due to the bracket shape the holder itself is very tight towards the door panel. It won't slip out if you don't want to. The large and medium coffee cups also accurately fit, the cans and the small cup have a little clearance, but they securely stay inside the holder even at strong shaking. So they'll be safe at full braking.
Instructions
I printed at 0.2mm layers with 95% infill and finished it with the soft part of a hook-and-loop tape for the lower support towards the door panel to avoid vibrations and damage.

We can still do trick or treating even in the middle of a global pandemic! We just need to not get too close. So here is one way to do it. Used along with the  GoPro Mop or broom mount by Rauglothgor (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1132874) this bowl can be a safe way to either accept a treat or give one out.
Of course one can also simply toss the candy to the little spooks and creatures!
I added supports under the GoPro mount.

How I Designed This
Summary
This is a small train I modeled from a player piece from a Mexican Train dominos set. I have not printed it yet (will be taking it to the library to print, soon), so of course, supports/rafts are highly recommended, especially since the wheels don't make much contact with the build plate.
Please post a make if you have made this! :)
v2 makes the following improvements:
Made the curve of the roof of the cabin more pronounced
Made the rear bumper a little bit smaller (doesn't reach as close to the ""ground""), and rounded on the bottom
Made the front ""cow catcher"" more pronounced (IIRC)
Print Settings
Rafts:
Yes
Supports:
Yes
Notes:
Raft necessary because there isn't that much of the model touching the build plate. Supports are most likely needed, because there's a few challenging overhangs, and the hole through the center would be difficult without supports.
UPDATE: I have successfully printed this part with NO supports, with only some minor ""crufting."" Honestly, even the slightly failed parts of the model look better than the prints that printed with support (because removing supports in PLA can be kind of brutal).
If you're not sure if you can get away with no raft & no supports, try printing it with supports from build plate only.
How I Designed This
I took measurements from the actual player piece using a digital caliper, and put it together in tinkercad.

This is a case is for cafealpha 's Sega Saturn Gamer's Cartridge!
The case itself uses a screwless design. The front cover can be printed without support but you'll need it for the back.
The front comes in two flavors. One has holes to show the LEDs when using an opaque plastic and one with none for transparent and semi transparent plastics. You'd be amazed on how most light colored plastics will show the LED light through.
The back cover comes in two flavors as well. One is plain and the other has cafealpha's cow mascot. Personally I think you print the one with the cow xD. 
If you don't know what it is it's a cool expansion cartridge that allows you to play backups, save your games directly to an SD card and much more. You can check it at:

Summary
Holder to zip tie onto the back of the WOWs to keep cufflators from doing nosedives as well as hold the iphones we use at our facility and some random other stuff. Needs supports to print, but otherwise should be easy to print. The 1 series I made was specific to the Metro Access point WOW/COW, though it may work for other carts, but there is new designs on the way for that! DISS threaded for O2 Christmas trees. Zip ties should be the only extra thing you need to complete, and i personally strap them to the back of the cart, but in theory it could be put on the front though the nubs are spaced specifically to fit in the screw holes for the aforementioned cart brand.

Update 4.   If you are looking for a scarier version of this, I've edited it into a horned dragon, here,
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3207987
Update 3.  Got the printer belt sorted, found that I was still having trouble, learned a bunch about remeshing, and sorted this to a 2.7Mb file!   Was 600,000 + triangles, down to 5,000 and still looks darn good!   Printed in glow in the dark PLA, then thermoformed via, pouring boiling water on the hinges (see video) and carefully bending.
https://youtu.be/RYOinbMbVqU
Update 2.  Finally got the printer sorted out, had to fix lower drive belt, then discovered that my triangle count was too high, and causing grief in my slicer, got that sorted out, then started printing without double checking to see that I had enough filament.   Arggg,  however, as far as it got, the print came out awesome, and by running out before much of the beak was printed, yahoo, I discovered I'm close to being able to reuse much of the drawing and have cow skull amor!   Here's a video
https://youtu.be/60jvBTBh4nE
Update 1.  I've added nasty bird 4b 10k.stl as an easier to print version (flat bottomed).   I like the more rounded look of the other files, however they keep pealing up off my print plate. 
I've been playing around with this interlocking skull/horn design for a while.  
Decided to make it into something.  
The photos are of an earlier version, where I'm still trying to optimize the horn size/position relative to the eye socket of neighbour.  
The .stl's I've included have larger horns, and have integrated chainmail joining them together.    The .stl is also for an assembly of 5, rather than the 3, and I think is perfect for a shoulder guard (pauldron), or...  
I've had a hard time reducing the number of triangles, while still maintaining an accurate surface.   I've included 2 levels of resolution, but I will probably update this with a better file.  
My printer is broken down, but should be back up in a few days :-).

This is a project for the cow lovers! I created this project for my Digital Fabrication class; the task was to create a design to raster onto a wooden block.  I created my design in Adobe Illustrator using a picture I found of a cow standing on a trampoline and added the text ""Milkshake.""  The picture did not turn out as clearly as I had hoped, but overall it was a fun project that allowed me to learn the basics of using a laser engraver.
Instructions
This project was created with a 40 watt Epilog Engraver using 60% speed and 100% power.

This is a djembe drum shell that can be 3D printed. It can then be headed and strung like an actual djembe, or it could just be painted.  
The drum in the attached file is about 14cm high, which is the larger drum in the photo, a good size for displaying on a shelf. It can easily be re-sized, for example to make drum necklaces.  
There are many resources online for how to head and string a djembe drum, and the process is very much the same for this scaled down version.  
Instructions
The drum in the photo was printed with a Makergear M2 using Simplify3D Creator at 20% infill and the default profile, using PLA filament.  
To make the drum in the photo:  
One good resource for how to string and head this drum after printed is http://www.rhythmhousedrums.com/blog/djembe-rehead-how-to/. Use that resource along with the instructions below which outline the differences in making this miniature drum.  
Yarn or hemp string could be used, and a goat or cow skin head. Trace the skin with an old CD, and cut it out.  Put the skin in water for at least an hour which makes it pliable to fit over the edges of the drum.  
Carbon steel welding wire was used to make the 3 rings.  Wrap the wire around itself, spiraling it as you go around,  about 4 times to make the ring thicker and stringer (see additional photos). The rings were then wrapped with cloth strips.

I am part of a growing community of makers here in Portland, Oregon. We call ourselves Layer Geeks and even have a club on meetup.com called the “Portland 3D printing lab”  We Love to talk about 3D printing and challenge each other to make. We also do fun projects like 3D print a life size cow #crowdcow. 
This project is by far one of my favorites to date, the Portland Art Museum asked me to 3D scan the Cantor foundation's statues made from the work of Auguste Rodin. With patience and a steady hand I guide my Ipad equipped with the Structure scanner from Occipital. In real time on an Ipad im able to see the object get recorded into a 3D printable object. I used Autodesk's Meshmixer application to size and clean up the scan. The Portland art Museum made this possible and I am truly lucky to be able to share these scans with my fellow makers. Go visit ""Auguste Rodin the human experience""  if you can (the exhibit is ongoing through April 2017). 
I invite you to have fun with the scans, make them for yourself or a friend so you too can be a part of the maker movement.

This is a 3D-printed filament holder designed to keep your filament spools organized and easily accessible. The holder features a sturdy frame that securely supports the spool, allowing for smooth and consistent unwinding of the filament during 3D printing. It uses two 608 ZZ bearings (8x22x7mm) to ensure smooth rotation and minimize friction. The holder is compatible with spools up to 200mm in diameter and 70mm in width, and it fits spools with a minimum inner diameter of 22mm. However, it's recommended to allow a bit of extra space, so spools with an inner diameter of approximately 23mm work best. Its minimalist design ensures it takes up minimal space on your workbench while providing maximum functionality. Ideal for makers and 3D printing enthusiasts, this filament holder helps maintain a tidy and efficient workspace.

A modular list. You can put papers inside the label holders, which themselves slide in the main frame so that the order can be changed at any time ! It can either be placed on a desk using the support or hanged onto a wall.
Ideal for to-do lists, lists of movies to watch or things to print ;)
I attached a pdf file (to be printed on a A4 paper with no margins) with lines to cut the labels at the right sizes.

June 2024 Update: Added a 0.3mm tolerance version as some people were having trouble with breaking it free. Use the 0.15mm 3mf print profile and replace in the 0.3mm STL version if you're trying to do multicolor.
My take on a simple print-in-place fidget keychain.
Features a gear wheel that rests against a spring mechanism.
Design
My initial v1 design was just a straight arm on a hinge, but after about a few hundred back and forth spins, the hinge would fatigue and break. For v2, I put a rounded hinge that would spread out the bending moments throughout the curve. So far, it's yet to break after fidgeting all day.
Tolerances are pretty tight at 0.15mm, so I have a 0.20mm version uploaded as well.
Printing
Print with no supports, at least 3 walls. Orient with the open side facing down so that the gear is touching the bed on the first layer.
Tested and printed on a Bambu X1C with PLA and PETG, although I think PETG would last a bit longer. PLA has a louder click than PETG.
If you aren't using default Bambu profiles, make sure your bridging settings are dialed in. Depending how good your bridging is, the print may require an initial “breaking free” when finished but shouldn't take much force at all.
If you want to print using multiextrusion, break the file apart in the slicer and assign the colors accordingly or check out the .3mf file (if using BambuStudio)

ATST in Legion Scale.
I downloaded an ATST model from somewhere and it was pretty good but looked like it had been ripped from a video game and so had a lot of obvious facets on it. I decided to accurise it a little and two weeks later, not a single polygon, edge or vertex remained of the original, so I have no qualms about calling this my own work rather than a remix. 
It comes in pieces for ease of printing and assembly should be pretty self explanatory but I've included instructions anyway. I may, at a later date include the legs in sections so that they can be posed. The neck joint is designed to push-fit so the head can remain rotatable.
This is scaled to Legion miniatures (38mm or 1:48) but if you want a more traditional 28-32mm scale model then print the pieces at about 80%. It should stand up to the reduction.
Modelled in Blender and the version photographed was printed on an Anycubic Photon.

How to make it
Summary
If you can't take care of a plant or don't want to pay for a fancy variant of Monstera, you're in the right place! Just print the planter and some leaves and your plant is ready.
Print at 0.2mm layer height. 
Types of leaves you can pick:
Deliciosa
Deliciosa variegata
Adansoni (Monkey mask)
Adansoni variegata
Minima
Minima variegata
There are 3 versions of the planter:
Big - big planter that fits 25 leaves
Medium - smaller version that also fits 25 leaves
Small - tiny planter that fits 13 leaves
It's available on printables if you want to earn some points!
How to make it
Veins
If you want to make the veins a different color, change the filament for the second layer. 
Variegata version
To make the lighter parts in variegata version, change the color of the third layer. (Use lighter color, white or beige)
Shaping leaves
To shape the leaves and stem, use a lighter. Bending them cold can break them. They are thin enough to be bendable after a second of applying heat. The leaves can be bent to look more realistic.
Bend the leaf inwards through the middle, then bend the sides down. This should give it more natural shape.
Finishing the plant
After you shaped the leaf, cut the stem to the desired length and put it into a slot in the pot. There are a lot of slots for leaves in the pots, so make your plant as dense as you want.

Kitchen towel roll holder

I got tired of constantly searching for the roll of kitchen towels: sometimes it's near the printer, sometimes on the desk, and sometimes in the kitchen. It never had a permanent place. Today, I decided to solve this issue once and for all by securing the roll in a fixed spot in the kitchen, so it's always within reach when needed. As a result, I created this 3D model of a kitchen towel roll holder.

This model is specifically designed for convenience and easy installation. It mounts effortlessly under a kitchen cabinet, providing a reliable holder for the roll. Regardless of the type of plastic you use to print this model, the key is that it should be durable. I printed my holder using ABS+HS from eSUN. This plastic is designed for high-speed printing. The ""+"" in the name signifies that it contains modifiers which reduce shrinkage and improve adhesion, resulting in higher quality and more durable products.

Such a holder will not only solve the problem of finding the roll but also add comfort and organization to your kitchen.

Keeps dried filament dry
Filaments like TPU and PETG need drying for the best 3D printing results. Even with dedicated filament dryers, the vents allow moisture to absorb back into the filament quickly.
Since it takes hours to dry, it is inconvenient to dry every time you need a print. The solution is a sealed dry box that you can feed to the printer.

It's a frog in a toad or frog in a frog or something. I drew inspiration from the Flexi Rexi Dino Eggs.
The toad is hinged, opens and shuts like a surprise egg, and hides a little articulated fidget frog inside.
Would probably look pretty good w/ AMS but I don't have AMS so I make due. Either way, my nieces and nephews really enjoy them. And they print fast!
Also, yes, those are marker dots for eyes. They're especially fun to color with markers and paint.

See also new Fidget Spiral Sphere : https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6704812
New spiral fidget design based on a 14 sided 3D shape (Tetradecahedron) with cool looking double vortex /star pattern (top and bottom). I wanted to avoid the thin/weak top parts of the tapered designs and produce something different. The inner part can pass freely through the outer part in both directions  (pass through).
The ""fingers"" on part 2 of this design are quite strong and do not taper to very thin points -avoiding stringing issues.   
Easy print - supports not required.   There is a generous clearance of 0.5mm (per side) between the parts.  Size 45 x 45 x 52mm.   Recommend to use brim when printing part 2 for good build plate adhesion.    
After printing check the sliding surfaces are smooth and free from blobs- do not force together if it does not slide freely - remove any blobs if resistance to sliding. 
14/7/24:  V2 version added -  reversed twist direction to align with conventional threads and finer mesh. See uploaded make for V2.

Blade Honing Guide

For those who work with handheld cutting tools, it's no secret how important it is to have the right edge sharpening. Without special devices, it's difficult to achieve proper sharpening or honing manually, and you can easily damage the edge, leaving you disappointed with the tool's performance. There are many ready-made tools on the market that can handle this task. Below, I've listed examples that are quite effective, but I was curious to create my own device, which, in my opinion, would work just as well, if not better, than the presented options. However, it all depends on your skills.

All parts of the device are made from eABS+HS plastic by the well-known company eSUN. Many are familiar with this plastic, but for those encountering the HS designation for the first time, let me explain: it stands for ""High Speed."" With the advent of high-speed printers, working with regular ABS plastic has become inconvenient, as its layers don't fuse well at high speeds. Printing slowly is no longer appealing, so eSUN's new developments come to the rescue, allowing for products with excellent strength characteristics, minimal shrinkage, and the ability to print at speeds up to 300 mm/s and accelerations up to 20000 mm³/s.

For the roller, I used TPU plastic from the same company. Why do I recommend TPU? The honing process involves the roller contacting abrasives, and regular plastic or metal bearing surfaces will wear out. However, a TPU roller will last much longer. I used flanged bearings F693ZZ. All component links are provided below.

To adjust the clamping jaws, I used a threaded rod with left and right threads on either side, M5x70 mm, along with M5 nuts with left and right threads.

I recommend printing all parts at full infill with maximum quality and minimum layer height.

Recommend printing flat with blank side down and tree supports for best results.
For the connecting dowels, a 5mm outer brim kept them stable during printing.
Also, for the text signs, recommend using tree supports and having small needle or tweezer-nose pliers to help get the support safely out of the kibble.

This Model is my gen 3 Long Sword, with a 60cm blade and an updated version of my v1 and v2 designs. the blades are now designed to have a unique topography over their length rather than a repeated section. 
from the previous version to get a slimmer blade this model is designed with 2x 7mm channels running through the model which is for 6mm or 1/4 inch wooden dowels.
I've just finished the series of 8 blade sizes from an 18cm blade length dagger to a 120cm blade length Claymore which the pummel is just printing and they'll be released slowly over time on here, purely because the search function isn't that great. so pop over to Patreon for early releases as a free member, basic pay gives you all the files for playing around, or if you want to sell models if you're lucky for a rennaisance faire near you that you think you might get profit selling there is a license level too. patreon/affini3 
I have lots of other asymmetrical blade designs and started on my first katana design which will be on patreon in the next two weeks or so. and I really want to do some more axes and maces
Hope you enjoy.

My daughter was showing me something similar on Etsy that she wanted for her new PC build, so I decided to make an attempt in Blender with geometry nodes and such before buying the premade version.
The initial export, though full of non-manifold geometry, was still printable in Cura.  To address the non-manifold geometry, I voxel remeshed, then ran a limited dissolve to reduce the poly count. I included both versions of the STLs to try.
Your results may vary.
(Update: Since I'm using geometry nodes, it's easy to create random variations. I added another version to try out, you'll need to scale this one manually by 200%.)

35mm Film Digitize Adapter with following features.
This adapter fits well to AI Micro-Nikkor 55mm f/2.8S with PK-13 Closeup Ring.
The opening of the film aperture is 38 x 26mm, so it can capture the full frame of the film without trimming. If this adapter is directly fit to Micro-Nikkor 55mm F2.8with PK-13 ring, the magnification ratio is around 0.95.
You can use either a lightbox or a LCD display of the computer.
This adapter has an opening to clean the front side of the film with a blower. Cap to avoid stray light is available.
A Locknut fixes the angle of the adapter securely.
** July 16, 2024 : Updated : The cap for the front opening is modified to be hinged. See the video below.
Video
How to make
The part ""holder2.stl"" needs support structure. Others do not need.
Print two copies of ""spring.stl"".
The screw to the lens and locknut is very fine. Please fine printing parameter if it does not well fit to the lens.
The surfaces facing to the film is flat. To avoid the scratches to the film, stick telemp (cloth) around the aperture.
Attach the cap to the hinge of the holder1.stl by pushing in.

This buckle can be used is multiple situations.  My design is simple to print and is of low cost and designed to accept a flat woven strap of up to 20mm width.
The strength of these buckles can be improved by choosing strong plastics.  Note that there needs to be some give in the plastic to allow the buckle to flex, hence carbon fibre based filaments may not do well.
The buckle is a common 20mm size, but you can also experiment and scale the buckle to your needs via your slicer software.
My print is made in eSUN PLA+ filament, with 0.2mm layer height and 15% infill on a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon printer.  Inner supports are needed for the female part.  See 3MF file.
I hope that you can find this print useful, too.
Remember to leave me some feedback or even a tip to keep me enthused to make more of these drawings.

Summary
This is a modular spice rack that you can print on (almost) any size printer. It can have as many slots and as many rows as you want. You can also use Thingiverse Customizer or OpenSCAD to change the size of container it works with, adjust tolerances, etc!
This system works by printing out 1 or more ""shelf"" pieces and fitting them together with the dovetail joints. Then you attach the uprights to the ends to make 1 ""shelf"" layer. You can slot multiple shelf layers together, and when you're done you can slot the foot piece to the bottom of the bottom 2 uprights.
For my printer, the tolerances were a nice fit. The feet were a little too loose though, so I used a drop of superglue in the joint to hold them closed.
The spice containers I used were these. And I found the smallest labels I could for them.

How I Designed This
Summary
This light bar mounts on the back of the X gantry and shines light directly on the current layer being printed. It was designed specifically for the Ender 3 Pro, but may work with other Ender 3s or any printer that uses a T-slot gantry bar.   Be sure that none of the assembly extends below the nozzle Z position.
After I got my Ender 3 Pro, I found it irritating that viewing the layer being printed (especially the critical first few layers) was so difficult due to the printhead being in the way and the shadow beneath.  All the lighting solutions that I found were mounted on the top crossbar, which made the shadow even deeper.   I saw that there was no reason that a light bar couldn't be mounted on the back as long as it didn't extend below the nozzle.  After considering it for some time, I came up with this arrangement.
Many places have LED strips that can be cut to length, and I recently found that they are available for 24V operation. So I designed a slotted rail that would accept the strip and a couple of brackets that attach to the back of the X gantry using T-Slot nuts.  The brackets are a snug fit on the ends of the rails, and the strip slides in from the end.  Power is taken directly from the power supply terminals.  The brackets are designed to be above the Z height of the current layer and the light shines down at an angle that illuminates the nozzle tip.  So that critical first layer can be viewed in good light. 
I have included a detailed construction document with pictures, and also the Fusion .f3d file if you need to make any adjustments or adapt to a different model printer. 
The LED strips are readily available on Amazon, as is the 24 Ga. speaker wire, although together they will cost around $20.  If there is interest, I might be talked into making wired LED strips available for moderate cost.... send me a message via Thingiverse if you are interested.
This is the first release of this design, so it should be considered a work in progress.  Let me know of any problems with it.

Notes:
Strip bar can be printed vertically without supports, but may be weak. Printing flat on the bed, slot side down with support is recommended. Infill is not critical, as stress is only an issue during assembly. I used Comgrow PLA, but any should work fine.
The clearance between the strip bar and the end brackets is 0.15mm all around, so it will probably be a pretty tight fit, especially if your printer is not closely calibrated.
Post-Printing
Full details are in the construction document.
Some soldering is required to attach the wires to the LED strip.
Installation calls for 8 mm screws, which may be hard to find.  10 mm are too long unless you add washers under the head.  I was able to make 6 mm screws work.
The brackets are intended to be mounted at the ends of the strip bar.  
How I Designed This
Designed with Fusion 360.  Modeled the LED strip bar, then added component for one end bracket, then mirrored it for the other bracket.

Hi All,
Here is a simple design for a phone stand that allows you to use it at two different angles: 30° and 45°. Compared to other interesting designs available online, this design offers faster printing time and significant flexibility in case of bumps and falls.
I hope you enjoy it!

Summary
The original print (without the lock) was a request from someone, then the lock for the handles was a request from more people, I figured why the heck not? Sounds easy right?
After a couple of design attempts I was able to get one that actually worked, and worked really well. If you've printed the first model without the lock, then you NEED to print this one! It works. Also included in the files is the locking trainer version, I figured someone would ask for it if I didn't include it…
This print has been wicked fun! It's still not going to carve a stick into a spear but you can practice with it before using the knife intended for doing that. Honestly though, it is great to fidget with and enjoy while impressing everyone you show it to. Best part is, now you don't have to worry about it coming open in your pocket! The locking handle holds it together until you're ready to fling it around.
If you're looking for the original, it's still there. This is more or less a remix. The original knife was used as the basis for this one, it just stands a little taller due to the lock needing to stand straight up for printing.
If you're curious about the background design steps I used to create this one, and want to see some printing failures while riding the emotional design rollercoaster with me, just check out the video.
https://youtu.be/3c6cpPPqE-U
I printed all of mine so far from PLA and Tough PLA, they all work flawlessly. Interested in seeing what materials you print with to share!
The YouTube video has a lot of background to this project and it's linked above so just give it a watch if you want to see more about it.
I hope you enjoy! Thanks for checking it out! If you like things like this be sure to check out the many other models I have here.

Its a simple doorstop that works. The pictures were taken with Prusament orange PETG and will be best in TPU. This was just a test in design and size. I have large gaps between my door and tile so wanted something about 1.5"" in height. No supports or rafts needed and if you want smaller, simply reduce the scale in your slicer aprox. 10% to 20% + / -
Enjoy and HAPPY PRINTING!!!!!!!

This is a work in progress. I don't have a bench grinder so that part is in the future. Using a belt sander at the moment. 
They want $40 for one online. 
I made a wood version of this before I got the 3d printer so just converted the material to PLA.
I only used supports for the knobs. Just rotate as you need. The extra material after removing the support makes the nuts and bolts fit tighter in the knob.
This is designed to use 2 1/4"" X 1.5"" and a (1/4"" X 2""  For the Tool Holder) bolts and nuts in the knobs. They pressure fit.

I tried making an air tight lid to save sodas for later. This is as close as I could get. It fits very tightly depending on the brand.
On some cans I could fill with water and turn them upside down with no leaks but if I squeezed the can it would leak so it's a tight but not perfect seal.
I also noticed that this varied from brand to brand. On Pepsi it fit the best. Very tight (takes a bit of force to put on). Brisk tea was a bit loose, still stayed on but not water tight. Diet Rite it fit good but not as tight as Pepsi...
Instructions
I printed with a .35mm nozzle and .20mm layer height.

The threading is a little rough just after the print but keep screwing the lid on and off a few times and it should get relatively smooth.

Snap on lid for soda or beer can
This lid can be handy if you don’t finish your drink. It is not completely air and water tight, but it is nice when handling your drink or if you put half a can in the fridge. 
Do not use infill higher than 10% on PLA. This will keep the lid flexible, so it is easy to get it of the can. There are two versions. One with a small brim for easy opening. It can be printed without support.
The lids on the picture are made in red (RFPLCXEU0JB) and neon green (RFPLCXEU0AD) PLA on my DaVinci Jr. The print quality were set to “Normal” without any alterations from the standard (10% infill, 0.3 mm layer height, no support, etc)

This is quite possibly the first thing I designed in Tinkercad before I ever even got a 3D printer or learned OpenSCAD.  I only tried printing this recently, and it came out great. Beehive loved it.  The lid fits delightfully well.   
Would make a great gift box.  You're welcome.

I had pretty good luck printing this with 3 perimeters and 50% infill.  You can see some slicing silliness on the lid, but the design didn't create a constant wall thickness.

Chip was getting a little lonely, so I decided to create Mrs. Potts to join him! I also decided to make her hollow and her lid removable, so she doubles as a container. You could also put liquids in this because the spout is hollow as well. But I don't recommend drinking anything out of it unless you can seal it extremely well with food safe stuff.
I created the model in Fusion 360 using the sculpting tools and sketches for the details. I sliced it in Simplify3D, printed it on my Da Vinci 1.0 Pro with Robo3D PLA filament. Then my wife painted it using spray paint, acrylic paints and paintbrushes. Then she coated the whole thing with a clear coat to give it a bit of extra shine.
Printer: Da Vinci 1.0 Pro (body) & Robo3D R1 (lid)
Filament: Robo3D PLA
Layer Height: 0.1mm
Supports/Raft: Yes (even on the inside)

Summary
A rack for lid storage.
I was gettiing tired of the loose lids in the drawer so I made this rack that fits in the drawer. It also look nice on the countertop (but take much less space hidden in the drawer!)
The kit is modular, print as many body as you like. Use one drop of hot glue in the peg holes then slide in the peg to combine parts.
There are pretty close to each other, so if your lids have big handles, you might want to print some 10mm spacers. If you use the spacers, make sure to also print the extended pegs.
Finish your project with the faceplate. I've included a blank faceplate, juste in case you don't like turtles.
UPDATE: I've added a thicker facepate, even more robust.

Notes:
I used Duramic marble PLA PLUS. This PLA contains black pigment that does not melt so I also used a 0.6 nozzle to avoid nozzle getting jammed. Did a very good job to my opinion. Take a look at the pictures.

This is a very little (20mm^2) box, with a matching lid.  It prints quickly on a MakerBot or RepRap, and the lid fits snugly.  It is perfect for carrying very small things, like one marble...  It is a great little demo print to show off your fabricator to impatient friends.
Instructions
Print out and enjoy!

Snap on lid for a soda can. Snaps on securely to many brands of cans, but is not perfectly airtight. This is designed so you snap on the front two clips first, then the clip with the lever.   
Instructions
Your print may fit too tight or not snap on at first, but simply take an exacto knife and scrape a bit of plastic off the clip with the lever on it until it works. Also make sure the channel is free of any debris or blobs. 
Part in photo was printed on a a Solidoodle2 with abs and sliced with slic3r at .2mm layers and 25% infill. This is about my 4th revision of this lid, all drawn in Google Sketchup (file attached).

Legends tell of a mighty Viking-themed lid designed for a whisky glass. Behold, the Helm of Glencairn!
This is designed to fit a Glencairn glass with a rim of inner-diameter of 42mm and outer-diameter of 46mm. You may wish to scale the model up or down slightly to fit other glasses.
Designed and modelled with Blender, prepared and exported with 3ds Max.

Rafts:
No
Supports:
No
Resolution:
0.1+ mm
Notes:
Designed to print without additional supports. There are two supports already included in the STL file, which snap off cleanly after printing.
There is a small amount of ""bridging"" on the inside when printing this model, so for best results print with a layer height of 0.1mm or thicker.
